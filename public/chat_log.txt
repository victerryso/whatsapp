6/02/2014 3:55:01 pm: Paul Khum: Because when people there think dentist. They think white guy and old

6/02/2014 3:55:18 pm: Paul Khum: And some practices there only employ white dental staff.

6/02/2014 3:55:33 pm: Paul Khum: Whether it be dentist or even just a dental assistant

6/02/2014 4:03:19 pm: Paul Khum: I don't know any cambo dentist around either?

6/02/2014 4:03:43 pm: Paul Khum: Was hoping belinda might of done something medical.

6/02/2014 4:04:48 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Anna's friend and sis is a doctor.
Dads a dentist

6/02/2014 4:06:03 pm: Paul Khum: Cambodian?

6/02/2014 4:09:12 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Short but damn hot

6/02/2014 4:09:19 pm: Paul Khum: Jen wants a Boob job. She wants it almost as bad as a new car, if not more!

6/02/2014 4:09:32 pm: Paul Khum: I told her "I love you already the way you are....."

6/02/2014 4:09:51 pm: Paul Khum: And that's the truth guys, I feel that it's unnecessary surgery

6/02/2014 4:10:15 pm: Khemarint Son: So would u let her get it

6/02/2014 4:10:17 pm: Khemarint Son: If she pushed

6/02/2014 4:10:32 pm: Paul Khum: I don't know if I can stop her? That's the questions.

6/02/2014 4:10:41 pm: Paul Khum: I can't say that I agree with it man

6/02/2014 4:11:13 pm: Paul Khum: I kinda like my women strong minded and confident. And didn't think she needed a c cup to make that happen

6/02/2014 4:12:26 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah I'm a bit mixed feeling about it man.

6/02/2014 4:12:54 pm: Paul Khum: Fair enough if she was in a accident (God forbid) and something happened to her boobs. And she felt the need to fix it

6/02/2014 4:15:17 pm: Paul Khum: I'm under the impression that she's more doing it to impress other guys... Like jen already with a hk movie star.

6/02/2014 4:16:04 pm: Khemarint Son: Haha

6/02/2014 4:16:22 pm: Khemarint Son: For me wanting boobs isn't a reflection on the confidence of a woman

6/02/2014 4:16:33 pm: Khemarint Son: Or her inert confidence etc

6/02/2014 4:16:45 pm: Khemarint Son: Lots of Asians getting them don't lately

6/02/2014 4:19:54 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah excessive is a bit much. Say like a double d?

6/02/2014 4:20:13 pm: Paul Khum: Actually I don't know bar sizes that well. It's not like I have a fetish around them Lol!

6/02/2014 4:20:37 pm: Paul Khum: But ye jen is wanting them as much as a new car.

6/02/2014 4:20:57 pm: Paul Khum: Man too many wants!

6/02/2014 4:28:59 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah heaps of Asian girls are getting it done

6/02/2014 4:29:18 pm: Paul Khum: Jen points it out to me all the time when a Asian girl has a nice rack

6/02/2014 4:29:34 pm: Paul Khum: "oh she had her boobs done....."

6/02/2014 4:29:48 pm: Paul Khum: 'come on babe, may be it's natural....'

6/02/2014 4:33:39 pm: Paul Khum: I don't know what you guys think about that?

6/02/2014 4:35:50 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Haha yeh Anna doesn't have the eye lids

6/02/2014 4:35:55 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Apparently I do

6/02/2014 4:41:53 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Tell her I got my eyes done

6/02/2014 4:42:43 pm: Paul Khum: She would probably believe me then she would day "pon got his eyes done. Look how much better he looks of he didn't....... I'm gonna get my eyes done too"

6/02/2014 4:43:12 pm: Paul Khum: "who did pon use? It looks so natural....." Fuck! Lol

6/02/2014 4:46:32 pm: Khemarint Son: Lmao imagine pon actually got his eyes done

6/02/2014 5:04:35 pm: Paul Khum: Probably, Lol just hiding it from the rest of us.

7/02/2014 12:09:12 am: Paul Khum: Cambodia currency rides on the green back (USD). $Aud is performing pretty well. Cambodia can't be more expensive than Bali? May be the flight cause its longer, but cost of living would be cheaper.

If your close enough to invite to a bucks
You should be invited to the wedding

7/02/2014 3:01:31 pm: Khemarint Son: Most circumstances anyway

7/02/2014 3:05:24 pm: Paul Khum: Yes correct, I agree

7/02/2014 3:05:53 pm: Paul Khum: Or sometimes they just invite people to the bucks to get the numbers up? A bit like pon and James. (^_-)

7/02/2014 3:07:46 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Yeh that's why ur invited

7/02/2014 3:08:08 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah I knew it.

7/02/2014 3:19:52 pm: Paul Khum: Pon as if you can't but?

7/02/2014 3:19:58 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Everyone has different expectations...

7/02/2014 3:20:15 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah but he knows for a fact that $50 is low.

7/02/2014 3:20:25 pm: Paul Khum: Man he buys one jacket $3k!

7/02/2014 3:20:26 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: I just read ur whole
Msg , and yes if he's balling then thT might look tight

7/02/2014 3:20:46 pm: Paul Khum: Has a room full of shoes. Which total 50k

7/02/2014 3:20:57 pm: Paul Khum: And what you rock up to a mates wedding with $50?

7/02/2014 3:21:04 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Yeh that is bad.

7/02/2014 3:21:24 pm: Paul Khum: I understand it's hard to judge

7/02/2014 3:21:41 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: I told Anna to not invite her lil cousins bf.. Gf.. Coz they're young and won't cover costs

7/02/2014 3:21:44 pm: Paul Khum: Bro this guy doesn't wesr cheap shit

7/02/2014 3:22:10 pm: Paul Khum: Hmm what if they do but? Lol I was young before and I use to pay my way

7/02/2014 3:22:47 pm: Paul Khum: Some filos are Fucken all for show. I hate that man. You wanna act like a balla, then bring it!

7/02/2014 3:24:14 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: U know too many filos

7/02/2014 3:24:40 pm: Paul Khum: I know heaps! This isn't the guy at the gym btw.

7/02/2014 3:25:05 pm: Paul Khum: The guy at the gym is a good filo. Even thought his cashed him. His still at home helping his mum.

7/02/2014 3:25:18 pm: Paul Khum: Man I went to a catholic school. Fucken all filo.

7/02/2014 3:25:32 pm: Paul Khum: You know how many Cambodians in my grade? Two!

7/02/2014 3:25:33 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Was it worth it

7/02/2014 3:25:53 pm: Paul Khum: Hmm that's a very subjective question.

7/02/2014 3:26:17 pm: Paul Khum: To answer it I would say, if I could afford to put my kids into a catholic school. I would

7/02/2014 3:27:48 pm: Paul Khum: The facilities are better, the duty of care is a bit more stringent. Yes there's a bit of bible bashing. But the kids generally come from homes with a good family. If a parent is willing to spend money on a child's education, then they generally care.
We didn't have no Fucken islanders in our school.

7/02/2014 3:30:16 pm: Khemarint Son: I agree with ya

7/02/2014 3:32:02 pm: Khemarint Son: I'll peobaly do the same if I have the money

Only know you're high when you're feeling low....
Only hate the road when you're missing home

10/02/2014 3:37:26 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah I'm looking up some back work outs.

10/02/2014 3:38:27 pm: Paul Khum: Dead lifts doesn't really do it for me. Well it does, but my form needs work. And I don't feel that it's as effective for me.

10/02/2014 3:38:55 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Then there's lower back and upper

10/02/2014 3:47:41 pm: Paul Khum: Dam man, I just thought back was back m

10/02/2014 3:52:22 pm: Khemarint Son: Ya dead lifts not an isolation so u won't feel it only in your back

10/02/2014 4:10:43 pm: Paul Khum: I see, I just thought I would be better doing other back work outs until I get a bit more use to dead lifts.

10/02/2014 4:11:38 pm: Khemarint Son: Anything cuz

10/02/2014 4:11:43 pm: Khemarint Son: Just keep consistency

10/02/2014 4:43:19 pm: Paul Khum: I'd say you and khem are intermediate to advanced. Where I'm still at beginners.

10/02/2014 4:54:43 pm: Terry So: When I do deadlifts, I usually look up. I don't know why but it makes my form right.

10/02/2014 4:55:18 pm: Khemarint Son: U sure ur form is right man ?

10/02/2014 4:55:24 pm: Khemarint Son: Takes along time to get good form

10/02/2014 6:34:28 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Is it true she can only spend that money in Bali

10/02/2014 6:35:35 pm: Marra Lim: She didn't hustle for the highest bidder. She sold it to channel 7. And that's life got a piece of the pie with channel 7.

10/02/2014 6:35:40 pm: Paul Khum: Nah I don't think so, think she can spend it anywhere? Not sure what the terms are

10/02/2014 6:35:59 pm: Marra Lim: Nine and ten didn't get a chance to put a bid in.

10/02/2014 6:36:02 pm: Khemarint Son: Apparently Bali government can claim money through things he's made

10/02/2014 6:36:11 pm: Khemarint Son: In some circumste a

10/02/2014 6:36:37 pm: Marra Lim: Well I'm sure a side deal can be organised between 7 and her.

10/02/2014 6:36:39 pm: Khemarint Son: Proceeds  of crime

10/02/2014 6:36:53 pm: Khemarint Son: It depends how she holds the money

10/02/2014 6:36:59 pm: Marra Lim: In order to pay minimal tax

10/02/2014 7:24:10 pm: Paul Khum: I didnt think it was a proceed of crime. Because she's already done the time for it.

10/02/2014 7:27:00 pm: Khemarint Son: It's just part of the same law in Australia

10/02/2014 7:27:15 pm: Khemarint Son: If u commit a crime you won't be able to profit from anything to do with it

10/02/2014 7:29:56 pm: Khemarint Son: But there are loopholes
Check out articles on the $3m ATM
They discuss this about her case

10/02/2014 7:30:22 pm: Paul Khum: Hmm I forgot about that, I just thought that she did the time for it so could sell her story about it.

21/02/2014 9:06:40 pm: Khemarint Son: Tmoz for Saigon

21/02/2014 9:47:13 pm: Terry So: Do people understand you over there?

21/02/2014 9:47:31 pm: Terry So: What? I'm the least likely to marry overseas.

21/02/2014 9:49:15 pm: Khemarint Son: Not really

21/02/2014 9:49:23 pm: Khemarint Son: My cambo sucks now

21/02/2014 9:49:27 pm: Khemarint Son: Takes alot of effort

21/02/2014 10:12:00 pm: Paul Khum: Okay from now on when we see each other. We're talking in Cambodian

22/02/2014 2:07:41 am: Terry So: From now on, I won't be able to understand you guys

22/02/2014 2:09:35 am: Paul Khum: Should we start taking lessons with Mr Ou?

24/02/2014 3:27:23 pm: Marra Lim: <image omitted>

24/02/2014 3:29:36 pm: Marra Lim: I'm not sure if refugees want to seek asylum in Cambodia. But good luck with this idea.

24/02/2014 3:41:36 pm: Paul Khum: As if Cambodia needs more refugees

24/02/2014 3:43:02 pm: Terry So: Lol, the foreign minister's name is "hor nam hong". Sounds Chinese.

24/02/2014 3:43:20 pm: Paul Khum: Badly!

24/02/2014 3:47:38 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Or viet

24/02/2014 3:47:44 pm: Marra Lim: It might not be such a bad idea. If refugees consent to stay Cambodia. They can bring money with them and possibly assist in the development of the country.

24/02/2014 3:48:02 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Refugees usually have no money

24/02/2014 3:48:20 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: It'll help with population growth

24/02/2014 3:48:22 pm: Marra Lim: I question that.

24/02/2014 3:50:09 pm: Marra Lim: Many refugees . E.g Captain Emad come here to milk Australia's welfare system. Even though his a millionaire back home.

24/02/2014 3:50:26 pm: Terry So: In general, the more people, the more people to work and make the economy grow. If the country is governed well, it can grow into the path of china

24/02/2014 3:51:08 pm: Marra Lim: But it's true many haven't got money, but some are just taking the piss out of the system. Which I don't blame them. Who doesn't want a better life.

24/02/2014 3:52:48 pm: Terry So: A better life is not in Cambodia if that's what they're after. I think of our parents as refugees where we start from the bottom and help the country in separate ways. We never sponged off centerlink for too long.

24/02/2014 3:55:13 pm: Paul Khum: Hmm, I don't know of it would be good. I think it would cause more tension in Cambodia.

24/02/2014 3:58:06 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Yeh ppl
I'm Cambodia needs more jobs

24/02/2014 3:58:28 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Refugees coming in will take all
The available jobs

24/02/2014 3:59:16 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Is this Australia's solution to not sending refugees to info

24/02/2014 3:59:21 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Indo

24/02/2014 3:59:38 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah I agree. Not sure if more refugees would be good.

24/02/2014 5:35:59 pm: Terry So: You know air Asia is having a sale. Flights for October till April. Checking now to see the prices. $480 return. Not are if that's good or not

24/02/2014 5:36:39 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Return ... Where

24/02/2014 7:03:36 pm: Paul Khum: So it's not a joint bucks any more?

24/02/2014 8:47:39 pm: Khemarint Son: This Cambodia thing is a crack up

24/02/2014 8:48:07 pm: Khemarint Son: Can u imagine selling your life got a chance of living in aus

24/02/2014 8:48:14 pm: Khemarint Son: And then you end up in Cambodia !!

24/02/2014 8:48:21 pm: Khemarint Son: Lmao

24/02/2014 8:51:40 pm: Khemarint Son: I'm with pon on this one
Refugees in this context won't have any money

24/02/2014 9:00:02 pm: Marra Lim: Your probably right. Especially when they are seeking refuge from a war torn country. And they are fleeing for their life. As your running from your home, where all your wealth is. So you can't bring much with you.

24/02/2014 9:01:34 pm: Marra Lim: According to news reports it cost 10k average to get on these boats. So the ones who really are poor wont have the funds to flee to a better place like Cambodia.

24/02/2014 9:04:58 pm: Khemarint Son: Yep that's right

24/02/2014 9:05:10 pm: Khemarint Son: Some of these people are doctors and shit

5/03/2014 1:26:31 pm: Paul Khum: Question why is malina on a adults table? Shouldn't she be on a kids table?

5/03/2014 1:50:13 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: That's Malinas friend

5/03/2014 1:54:29 pm: Paul Khum: Shouldn't they be on the kids table?

5/03/2014 2:00:22 pm: Paul Khum: Is she in high school?

5/03/2014 2:00:39 pm: Paul Khum: So you would say she's a adult?

5/03/2014 2:02:27 pm: Paul Khum: So this menu it's set for menu 1? I understand terry wanting menu 2, since his not a seafood person

5/03/2014 2:03:58 pm: Terry So: Yeah, more food for you guys. Gonna eat beforehand and most likely afterwards.

5/03/2014 2:05:27 pm: Terry So: She's not an adult. She's a teenager. Kids run around screaming.

5/03/2014 2:09:35 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah true I just thought there was a kids table

5/03/2014 2:10:07 pm: Paul Khum: And who is this friend she's bringing? Just wondering I don't really care.

5/03/2014 2:11:39 pm: Terry So: She's like my khem. Always been around since we were young.

5/03/2014 2:20:52 pm: Paul Khum: Are you talking about soriyana? I thought you didn't know who she was? Lol

5/03/2014 2:21:17 pm: Terry So: When pon mentioned friend, it hit me.

5/03/2014 3:04:41 pm: Paul Khum: What you think of two menus?

5/03/2014 3:05:29 pm: Paul Khum: Pon -  terry is allergic to seafood and almost everything else that is eatable. Which is why were preferring menu 2

5/03/2014 3:05:41 pm: Khemarint Son: Don't really care

5/03/2014 3:05:45 pm: Khemarint Son: I'd choose menu 1

5/03/2014 3:05:50 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Terry is an exeception

5/03/2014 3:05:54 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: They already know that

5/03/2014 3:06:26 pm: Khemarint Son: It's got abalone and mud crab

5/03/2014 3:06:39 pm: Khemarint Son: Over sizzling pork

5/03/2014 3:06:49 pm: Khemarint Son: Can't argue against that !

5/03/2014 3:07:13 pm: Paul Khum: Abalone is shit but!? It's expensive yes, but it's like eating rubber

5/03/2014 3:07:40 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: depends how fresh and how it's cooked

5/03/2014 3:07:41 pm: Paul Khum: Mud crab. Let's see how many people know or will eat all the crab.

18/03/2014 7:18:15 pm: Terry So: I don't think my one has much respect in the watch business

18/03/2014 8:14:49 pm: Marra Lim: I think it's a dying market and the current market is really competitive .

18/03/2014 8:15:32 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: What do u mean

18/03/2014 8:16:54 pm: Marra Lim: Retailers are used as a show room, people get a part no's and buy elsewhere for cheaper

18/03/2014 8:20:51 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Nothing wrong with ur watch tho terry. It's still a nice watch.

18/03/2014 8:21:14 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Watch is stil a watch , like a car is just a car

18/03/2014 8:22:19 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Ppl just have different wants

18/03/2014 9:03:57 pm: Terry So: Ah, you have the Ferrari of watches. I have a brand name car with no performance lol

19/03/2014 9:00:59 am: Marra Lim: Morning cousins, the house I just purchased is gonna be settled this Friday arvo (the time I get the keys).

I won't be having a house warming as I need a tennant in there ASAP. So if your free your welcome to check the place out this Saturday at 1:30pm.

rea-app://listing/412545643

19/03/2014 9:02:20 am: Marra Lim: By the way, it's an open house to the open public also. So watch your P's and Q's. I don't want people knowing I'm the home owner.

19/03/2014 9:09:57 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Ur gnna skew the no. of possible interested parties for the real estate

19/03/2014 9:13:57 am: Marra Lim: Yeah, most probably. I'm not too concerned about misleading the agent. As long as I'm self aware. In the end, we only need that 1 tennant that fits our requirement.

19/03/2014 9:18:22 am: Paul Khum: Should we have a house warming Saturday afternoon?

19/03/2014 9:19:12 am: Marra Lim: That sounds like a plan .

19/03/2014 9:19:55 am: Marra Lim: It's gonna be shit , no furniture and we might only do pizza. And sit on the floor old skool cambo style

19/03/2014 9:20:19 am: Marra Lim: I'll have to run it by the boss Riana .

19/03/2014 9:20:22 am: Ponnorraks Ou: I always so BBQs at my house with a portable ppl and everyone on the ground

19/03/2014 9:20:41 am: Ponnorraks Ou: <image omitted>

19/03/2014 9:20:47 am: Ponnorraks Ou: WTf for....

19/03/2014 9:20:50 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Be a man!

19/03/2014 9:21:18 am: Paul Khum: Haha come on pon, he's trying to be a bit more like you.

19/03/2014 9:21:22 am: Paul Khum: Balance!

19/03/2014 9:27:40 am: Ponnorraks Ou: I'd check to see if we had any other plans.. If not, tell her the guys are coming over for a BBQ.

19/03/2014 9:28:50 am: Marra Lim: Yeah. Ok. I'm the boss now

19/03/2014 11:19:48 am: Terry So: I always like the idea of milk crates. Does anyone have them?

19/03/2014 11:20:06 am: Terry So: Where's the house? Ffld?

19/03/2014 11:20:10 am: Paul Khum: Nah I don't....

19/03/2014 11:20:47 am: Paul Khum: And terry if your watch can tell the time, it's just as good as Pons watch .

19/03/2014 11:20:56 am: Terry So: Hmm, I finish up at around 5pm. So I'll have to see. I can bring some takeaway from the city.

19/03/2014 11:21:28 am: Terry So: Hahahah that's what my watch is for. A more formal way of saying "I wanna get out of here/hurry up"

19/03/2014 11:26:02 am: Paul Khum: Hhaha yep, easier than pulling out your phone

19/03/2014 11:26:39 am: Ponnorraks Ou: I usually look at my phone for the time

19/03/2014 11:29:03 am: Terry So: I've noticed looking at your phone gives off a rude image that you're not paying attention. The watch says I gotta get out at a certain time and when it hits that second, I'm out.

19/03/2014 11:32:28 am: Paul Khum: Haha Nah you can't be looking at your phone pon when you've spent all that coin on the watch

19/03/2014 11:33:10 am: Paul Khum: But I think that's because your still use using your phone

19/03/2014 11:50:44 am: Paul Khum: Yeah I would agree that looking at your watch is better than pulling out your phone. Looks worse if you pull out your phone and you have a watch on Lol.

19/03/2014 12:01:07 pm: Paul Khum: First death / casualty reported in the Ukraine. War has pretty much started

19/03/2014 12:01:48 pm: Paul Khum: Guys my gut is telling g me that this missing flight is a diversions yo what really is happening in in the Ukraine / Russia

19/03/2014 12:57:57 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Is the fight for the land between Ukraine and Russia?

19/03/2014 12:58:36 pm: Paul Khum: Correct, but it gets a bit more technical than that.

19/03/2014 1:00:26 pm: Paul Khum: The thing is the area which they are fighting over (Crimea)  have just voted to join Russia.

19/03/2014 1:02:35 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Can't believe there's still war in this day and age

19/03/2014 1:02:54 pm: Paul Khum: The 85% of the people have turned up to vote. And 95% of those voted have voted to join Russia

19/03/2014 1:03:29 pm: Paul Khum: Which mean from a democracy point of view there's no need to go to war.

19/03/2014 1:04:12 pm: Paul Khum: Nah no matter what day or age it is, there will always be war. Or some form of violent turmoil

19/03/2014 1:04:54 pm: Paul Khum: It wasn't that long that Cambodia had one of the worst genocide in the world. Like who would kill their own people like the Cambodians?

19/03/2014 1:06:49 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: So are the ppl there Ukraine ppl or Russians

19/03/2014 1:07:19 pm: Paul Khum: Hmm there actually mixed

19/03/2014 1:08:01 pm: Paul Khum: The reason is they don't want to join Ukraine because Ukraine is being pushed to joined the eu (European union)

19/03/2014 1:08:32 pm: Paul Khum: The eu will suck a country dry of money. We have seen this happen already with Greece, Italy and Spain

19/03/2014 1:45:48 pm: Paul Khum: 75% of the people currently living in Crimea are Russian, they've been fighting over this land for 100s of years now.

19/03/2014 1:46:57 pm: Paul Khum: Crimea has the second largest naval port that Russia has. Last year Russia bailed out the Ukraine by giving 70billion dollars.

19/03/2014 1:48:40 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Almost sounds like Cambodia and Vietnam

19/03/2014 1:48:44 pm: Paul Khum: This could happen to Cambodia guys. Say one day (like now)  we have a large population of Vietnamese living in Cambodia, and they suddenly hold a vote to join Vietnam.

19/03/2014 1:48:54 pm: Paul Khum: Yes exactly pon.

19/03/2014 1:49:24 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Cambodia will lost the vote and lose a war

19/03/2014 1:49:34 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Vietnam is too strong

19/03/2014 1:49:40 pm: Paul Khum: Yes it would 😫

19/03/2014 1:50:13 pm: Paul Khum: They are strong. They've been at war 25-30 years before Cambodia went into Genocide

19/03/2014 1:50:44 pm: Paul Khum: Very similar to Cambodia and Vietnam.......

19/03/2014 2:13:38 pm: Paul Khum: Vietnamese people are very cunning..... The use women to manipulate and infiltrate Cambodian communities....
E. G. Pons family

19/03/2014 2:13:48 pm: Paul Khum: 😜

19/03/2014 2:15:18 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Definately going a bit over the line there.

Crazy the things cambodias teach their kids

19/03/2014 2:16:12 pm: Paul Khum: Hahaha so you are paying attention Lol

19/03/2014 2:16:38 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Slick of it to be honest

19/03/2014 2:16:50 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Even grandma mentioned it to me

19/03/2014 2:17:28 pm: Paul Khum: Laughing about it is the first step to healing.

19/03/2014 2:17:46 pm: Paul Khum: Lol what did grandma say to you?

19/03/2014 2:19:17 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Pretty much wat u said
Translated in Khmer

19/03/2014 2:19:34 pm: Paul Khum: Hahahaha

19/03/2014 2:21:55 pm: Paul Khum: All you got a do now is have kids with Anna and teach the kids Cambodian.... Then it's all good cuz

19/03/2014 2:22:27 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: That will be difficult if she leaves the kids with her mum

19/03/2014 2:23:17 pm: Paul Khum: Hmm true.... What about leaving them with your mum?

19/03/2014 2:23:39 pm: Paul Khum: Balance it out..... Cambodian grandma one week.... Viet grandma....... Never

19/03/2014 2:24:43 pm: Paul Khum: I mean Viet grandma the other week

19/03/2014 4:24:19 pm: Paul Khum: Oh the thing with this Ukraine / Russia and Cambodia / Vietnam.  Is that this party of Ukraine was formerly Russia. So if a part of Cambodia / Vietnam was historically a part of Cambodia, could Cambodia turn around and reclaim land from Vietnam?

19/03/2014 5:06:37 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Cambodia will never get its land back. There's almost 100M Vietnamese controlling Vietnam compared to 14M in Cambodia.

They just need to let go and protect the borders that we currently have

19/03/2014 5:07:53 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: The problem is the government letting viets into the country..... Who we gnna blame for losing land? Viets looking for more space to live or the Cambodian gov allowing them to enter

19/03/2014 5:11:54 pm: Paul Khum: I think your wife has gotten you to pon Hahaha

19/03/2014 5:12:40 pm: Paul Khum: Nah I now what you mean. Vietnam are strong.. But we never know.... May be not reclaim historic land. Buy hoping that Cambodia will continue to exist in the future

19/03/2014 5:13:28 pm: Paul Khum: If there any chance that Cambodians and Vietnamese can live together in Cambodia harmoniously?

19/03/2014 5:14:09 pm: Paul Khum: May be we can win our Vietnamese neighbours over and convert them to Cambodians? Like what your doing with Anna? 😜

19/03/2014 5:14:09 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Yes... Cambodia continuing to exist is definately a concern

19/03/2014 5:14:40 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah I'm worried were going to be whipped off the face of the earth..... 😥

19/03/2014 5:14:43 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: I'm with u on that. But blaming the enemy isn't going to help

19/03/2014 5:15:38 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: So  sick of it. Every house party with Cambos ... Yuen this yuen that

19/03/2014 5:15:45 pm: Paul Khum: Nah doesn't help at all...

19/03/2014 5:15:52 pm: Paul Khum: Hahahaha pon!

19/03/2014 5:16:36 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: They're smart ppl. And I'm sure if u were in their position  ud do the same.

19/03/2014 5:17:09 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Someone allows u to move freely into their country where there may be better source of foods .. Ud do it

19/03/2014 5:17:20 pm: Paul Khum: They are very smart man........ Good looking as well (some of them)

19/03/2014 5:18:44 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: That's just my view.. I know there's a. Problem . But they're hating on the wrong ppl

19/03/2014 9:11:26 pm: Paul Khum: <image omitted>

20/03/2014 9:01:33 am: Paul Khum: They are talking about the housing commission at millers point, on the radio. Just what we were talking about last Friday.

20/03/2014 9:02:29 am: Paul Khum: They said they are planning to sell the whole lot off and send the people living there to other public housing.

20/03/2014 9:03:41 am: Paul Khum: A report by the government said the coat of renovating / fixing up the houses is $800k each. Which is one reason why they want to sell it off

20/03/2014 9:14:48 am: Paul Khum: Also some of the people living these housing commission for 5 generations. Just to put that in perspective, we are 1st generation Australian born immigrants

20/03/2014 9:26:45 am: Paul Khum: <image omitted>

20/03/2014 9:27:07 am: Paul Khum: <image omitted>

20/03/2014 9:42:52 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Guessing the ppl
Living there has an opportunity to buy it?

20/03/2014 9:49:34 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Let's put some $ together and buy there

20/03/2014 9:49:41 am: Paul Khum: No they won't. Unless they are able to pay market rate.

20/03/2014 9:50:03 am: Paul Khum: We can guys. We can form a partnership.

20/03/2014 9:51:20 am: Paul Khum: The argument that the government is using is that they want to sell it at market rate. To get as much revenue and use this to supply more public housing  needs.

20/03/2014 9:52:04 am: Paul Khum: A few people (who live in the area) have called the radio station up complaining saying that they are relocating their whole community

20/03/2014 9:52:44 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Specifically the housing near the  harbour bridge?

20/03/2014 9:55:00 am: Ponnorraks Ou: wonder where they would relocate them..

20/03/2014 9:55:17 am: Ponnorraks Ou: They've got one of the best locations in Sydney

20/03/2014 9:58:53 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Wat do u think the market value will b.

20/03/2014 10:01:01 am: Paul Khum: Yep around the having bridge bro. I work directly across housing  commission! Imagine if I lived across the road.... I'd probably still rock up to work late

20/03/2014 10:02:14 am: Paul Khum: Yes if we are serious (I am)  we can form a partnership  between all of us... Or a joint venture... Create a business / company. In essence we will become property developers

20/03/2014 10:03:18 am: Paul Khum: We set the ground work now... We won't need to work as hard. And our children won't need to depending on public housing... Like these  bums.

20/03/2014 10:03:56 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Wonder of my work friend is aware of it

20/03/2014 10:04:15 am: Terry So: If you play the game of thrones, you play to win.

24/03/2014 3:34:52 pm: Paul Khum: So you up load a photo of yourself? And if a girl thinks your hot and you think she's hot. You get to exchange contact numbers? Is that how it works?

24/03/2014 3:35:30 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Somethin like that

24/03/2014 3:35:31 pm: Terry So: Instead of exchanging numbers, it creates a chat between you two in the app

24/03/2014 3:35:42 pm: Paul Khum: Oh mad!

25/03/2014 10:34:34 am: Marra Lim: Craig Thomason : 3 months jail

25/03/2014 10:34:50 am: Marra Lim: Thomson

25/03/2014 10:34:54 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Who's that

25/03/2014 10:35:26 am: Marra Lim: 12 months sorry

25/03/2014 10:35:33 am: Marra Lim: Labor dude

25/03/2014 11:19:27 am: Paul Khum: It's pretty fucked up what happened to him. He was on TV before crying because the media was following Jim and his family around. To the point that they were taking photographs of his wife whole showering!

25/03/2014 11:20:05 am: Paul Khum: Okay the story with Mr Craig Thomson, Is that he's a politician and was a trade union official for the health services union.

25/03/2014 11:20:50 am: Paul Khum: What he did wrong was use union money along with public money to pay for personal expense. Such as prostitutes, flights for his wife and family... Holidays... Etc..

25/03/2014 11:22:23 am: Paul Khum: In my opinion all public servants do this. Use public money for their own personal agenda. The problem with Craig is that he got caught.

25/03/2014 11:24:09 am: Paul Khum: Prostitutes were paid on his business credit card. When they question him about it. He said "I was asleep in the hotel, someone must of came into my room stole my credit card, paid for the prostitutes and put my credit card back into my wallet........" lol!

25/03/2014 12:09:51 pm: Marra Lim: In a nut shell. He was convicted, but has always denied it. Everyone around him knows he did it, and prostitute even came out and said yes, he paid me for sex.

25/03/2014 12:10:27 pm: Paul Khum: Hahaha yep, just like bill Clinton. When ever your caught... Just deny deny deny

25/03/2014 12:11:14 pm: Marra Lim: I kind of feel sorry for his family. However I have a feeling they knew he was using the publics money for their holiday. I was hoping he would get a longer sentence to prevent corruption.

25/03/2014 12:12:15 pm: Paul Khum: Yrah I feel sorry for the family too. Being busted by prostitutes...

25/03/2014 12:12:15 pm: Marra Lim: His wife has always stood by his side . But wasn't at court today to hear the sentence.

25/03/2014 12:16:33 pm: Marra Lim: Imagine the in house fighting that's going on. You boys went to the brothel for fee, man why no invite..

25/03/2014 12:17:29 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Marra knows not to use plastic to pay for those things

25/03/2014 12:17:38 pm: Paul Khum: Hahaha

25/03/2014 12:17:45 pm: Paul Khum: Cash is king baby

25/03/2014 12:17:47 pm: Marra Lim: Hahah.

25/03/2014 12:28:07 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Schnitzel sandwich from iga

25/03/2014 12:29:31 pm: Paul Khum: How much is that? There's a iga behind my work too. But expensive

25/03/2014 12:32:41 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: $8

25/03/2014 1:34:47 pm: Khemarint Son: Ful Thompson bro

26/03/2014 1:28:47 pm: Paul Khum: The fact that they want to introduce toll roads around the suburbs and charge those who use their cars the most.

26/03/2014 1:32:49 pm: Paul Khum: It's a removal of our freedom and liberties!

26/03/2014 1:33:14 pm: Paul Khum: It will not reduce the cost of petrol. It will do little to reduce traffic congestion.

26/03/2014 1:33:21 pm: Khemarint Son: Very 1984esque

26/03/2014 1:33:28 pm: Khemarint Son: When are.they gonna chip me.up

26/03/2014 1:34:48 pm: Paul Khum: Omg don't even get me started on the microchip!
They are trying to go cash less.. How? By inflating the dollar so much that it's worth nothing. Then implement a global currency... That's when the end will come... So I sound a bit crazy?

26/03/2014 1:35:27 pm: Paul Khum: It won't be for a while, they are trying to condition the public to slowly accept things.

26/03/2014 1:36:30 pm: Paul Khum: Obama has spent 17 trillion dollars in 5 years. It took the USA 200 years to spend that much. From the days of George Washington!

26/03/2014 1:37:03 pm: Paul Khum: Man Obama isn't even America. He was Fucken born in Kenya. His grandmother said she witness his birth. Lol fail!

26/03/2014 1:39:30 pm: Khemarint Son: Wasn't he born in hawai

26/03/2014 1:42:54 pm: Paul Khum: Nah that's Bs!

26/03/2014 1:43:10 pm: Paul Khum: No one at the school he claims he went to remembers him

26/03/2014 1:43:17 pm: Paul Khum: He doesn't even have a birth certificate Lol!

26/03/2014 1:43:37 pm: Paul Khum: And hasn't shown his birth certificate to anyone.

26/03/2014 1:45:27 pm: Khemarint Son: Why would.he need.to show anyone his birth cetoficste

26/03/2014 1:46:11 pm: Paul Khum: To prove that he was born in the USA. Why? Because under the USA constitution. You need to be born in the USA to be the President.

26/03/2014 1:46:28 pm: Khemarint Son: Literally no other president

26/03/2014 1:46:31 pm: Khemarint Son: Was asked.of.this

26/03/2014 1:46:38 pm: Khemarint Son: Why was he?

26/03/2014 1:46:49 pm: Terry So: That's racist!

26/03/2014 1:46:54 pm: Khemarint Son: And there.have been.plenty of people that remember.him

26/03/2014 1:47:07 pm: Paul Khum: Others have a proper birth certificate and shown it

26/03/2014 1:47:09 pm: Khemarint Son: This.was.brought up when it was discussed that he smoked.grass

26/03/2014 1:47:20 pm: Khemarint Son: No they havnt

26/03/2014 1:47:51 pm: Paul Khum: It's not because he's black, but because it's corrupt how he got into power.

26/03/2014 1:48:03 pm: Khemarint Son: Show Me a source.theb

26/03/2014 1:49:17 pm: Terry So: How'd we get from suburban road tolls to Obama?

26/03/2014 1:49:52 pm: Paul Khum: See that's why he's the right man for the job. Because he's black. If you don't agree with any of his policies..... "oh your a racist...."
He currently had a approval rating of 6% by the people. They all knew he was black when he started. It's because of his policies like Obamacare that people don't like him

26/03/2014 1:50:33 pm: Khemarint Son: Show me a source where any president.was.asked for their birth certificate

26/03/2014 1:50:49 pm: Khemarint Son: And they showed it publically

26/03/2014 3:13:52 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Ye that's my email

26/03/2014 3:19:24 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah that's true with the info. But it wouldn't be much of a conspiracy if all the information was available. We're at a information war.

26/03/2014 3:20:49 pm: Paul Khum: Watch "null" on YouTube - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8_AVq6prCs

2. Increase the frequency of buses and trains for the South line.

26/03/2014 3:38:07 pm: Paul Khum: Did you guys know that you can only buy oil (petrol) in usd$? Which would explain why the USA dollar has been the leading currency for so long.

26/03/2014 3:39:17 pm: Paul Khum: USA politics do affect Australia in some way. If the USA go to war, we generally will follow being  allied with them. Just like Australia followed with Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan

26/03/2014 3:54:08 pm: Khemarint Son: War sucks

26/03/2014 3:54:16 pm: Khemarint Son: Tho it.does bring.about innovation

27/03/2014 12:52:22 am: Terry So: http://www.theshovel.com.au/2014/03/25/Australia-to-reinstate-imperial-measurement-system/

27/03/2014 12:54:42 am: Paul Khum: Dam serious? Well I'm already using the imperial system for measuring some things. 😜

27/03/2014 12:56:04 am: Terry So: It's satire. My message: don't believe everything you read.

27/03/2014 12:56:43 am: Paul Khum: Hey its on the internet, so it must be true right?

27/03/2014 12:57:59 am: Paul Khum: Should we get a ounce for the weekend terry?

27/03/2014 12:59:03 am: Terry So: What are we getting?

27/03/2014 1:00:57 am: Terry So: Some what?

27/03/2014 1:15:56 am: Paul Khum: If you play the game of thrones, you play to win.

27/03/2014 1:26:52 am: Terry So: Yeah, don't think we're on the same page.

27/03/2014 1:27:16 am: Paul Khum: Lol nah

27/03/2014 10:04:31 am: Paul Khum: Guys what are your thoughts on immunisation?

27/03/2014 10:05:26 am: Terry So: I understand the scientific theory behind it, I'm for it.

27/03/2014 10:05:03 am: Khemarint Son: Think its solid science.behind it

27/03/2014 10:05:14 am: Khemarint Son: Can't see any reason why people wouldn't do.iy

27/03/2014 10:05:15 am: Khemarint Son: U

27/03/2014 10:06:05 am: Paul Khum: Well there's been reports by many family's in Australia and around the world that certain immunisation causes autism

27/03/2014 10:07:51 am: Paul Khum: girls who are 5 years old. Getting immunisation for cervical cancer then suddenly develop autism

27/03/2014 10:08:33 am: Terry So: You know autism is a mental disability... And you know the flu strand gives you a cold... Please, connect the dots.

27/03/2014 10:10:36 am: Paul Khum: Cause there's mercury used as a preservative of certain immunisation

27/03/2014 10:11:49 am: Terry So: Suddenly? People just wants to blame someone/something. It's tragic that their child developed autism but to blame something that has been saving our lives on so many different levels...

27/03/2014 10:12:19 am: Paul Khum: Not specific to the flu vaccine. But the h1n1 immunisation, the cervical cancer immunisation, have had resulted after  immuncation

27/03/2014 10:12:39 am: Paul Khum: How do you know it's saving your life? Cause they tell you it is?

27/03/2014 10:12:54 am: Paul Khum: Hey its on the internet so it must be true right?

27/03/2014 10:14:16 am: Paul Khum: So how do you explain children who are grade a students at age 5. Getting immunisation at school. Then within 40mins of receiving the immunisation go into convulsions and then become autistic?

27/03/2014 10:15:12 am: Terry So: How do YOU know that it wasn't an independent variable which caused it?

27/03/2014 10:15:39 am: Paul Khum: Like what independent variable?

27/03/2014 10:16:22 am: Terry So: Anything else in the world. Just cause I drank some coke, doesn't mean it was the reason for my headache.

27/03/2014 10:16:21 am: Paul Khum: We don't, the only link we have is the immunisation vaccine with was administered to the child a few minutes before

27/03/2014 10:17:25 am: Paul Khum: Like what else in the world? You need to have something happened to you within the time frame of developing that symptom

27/03/2014 10:17:55 am: Paul Khum: Your headache was most likely due to the coke you had.

27/03/2014 10:18:02 am: Terry So: Okay... Before you jump to that conclusion, what causes autism?

27/03/2014 10:19:25 am: Paul Khum: Could be a factor of things, but I ain't a expert on it, are you?

27/03/2014 10:20:40 am: Terry So: So why are you listening to people who don't know a thing on autism?

27/03/2014 10:20:57 am: Terry So: You know who also has autism? People who don't get vaccinated.

27/03/2014 10:21:43 am: Terry So: You know how else I got that headache? My hangover from the night before.

27/03/2014 10:22:09 am: Paul Khum: Well that would be the reason for your headache then

27/03/2014 10:22:13 am: Paul Khum: Cause and affect

27/03/2014 10:22:37 am: Terry So: You said it was the coke

27/03/2014 10:23:05 am: Paul Khum: Yeah cause you said you drank the coke  and then had the headache.?

27/03/2014 10:23:17 am: Paul Khum: You didn't say you were drunk the night before

27/03/2014 10:24:31 am: Terry So: And what else do you know about how that kid ended up with autism?

27/03/2014 10:24:37 am: Paul Khum: These are parents who have had healthy children. Then after they received certain immunisation they had a reaction to it 30 mins later going into convulsion and then becoming autistic

27/03/2014 10:26:10 am: Terry So: My friend suddenly collapsed in his room, blood clogging his lungs. The reason HAS to be the coke he drank a minute ago!

27/03/2014 10:26:58 am: Terry So: Healthiest child I know.

27/03/2014 10:29:38 am: Paul Khum: No that's all we know, these parebts are trying to find other links to what may have caused it. But the only link they can link it to thr vaccination

27/03/2014 10:30:10 am: Paul Khum: Is that a true story or are you just on a coke bashing?

27/03/2014 10:30:35 am: Terry So: True story, no coke involved.

27/03/2014 10:30:44 am: Paul Khum: And this isn't just one case terry, but thousands in the states and usa

27/03/2014 10:30:45 am: Terry So: Khem knows the guy too. Ronald lee.

27/03/2014 10:32:14 am: Khemarint Son: I'm with terry 100% here

27/03/2014 10:32:26 am: Khemarint Son: His put up all my.valid points

27/03/2014 10:33:00 am: Khemarint Son: Let me.reqd.more about it

27/03/2014 10:33:05 am: Khemarint Son: Then I will.give.a better response

27/03/2014 10:51:57 am: Paul Khum: Certain vaccination which have had a long proven historical success (20 years plus)

27/03/2014 10:52:13 am: Paul Khum: But new ones I'm a bit sceptic on

27/03/2014 10:52:30 am: Terry So: Do you watch suits?

27/03/2014 10:52:54 am: Paul Khum: Nah I don't, well I watched season 1 that's it

27/03/2014 10:53:06 am: Paul Khum: Why?

27/03/2014 10:53:55 am: Terry So: Remember that episode with Jessica Pearson's ex husband? Same story

27/03/2014 10:54:25 am: Khemarint Son: I havnt heard of this instances where kids have.gotten vacninations and got autism straight away

27/03/2014 10:54:41 am: Khemarint Son: I will read up on it.and respons after.

27/03/2014 10:54:49 am: Paul Khum: Nah I don't remember it. Let me watch it and I'll get  back to ya

27/03/2014 10:55:19 am: Khemarint Son: U made.it sound like.this.was thr norm

27/03/2014 10:55:53 am: Khemarint Son: For.people.that have.made Tue connection between autism.and.  vaccinations

27/03/2014 10:57:13 am: Paul Khum: Nah it's a certain percentage, it's not like 100% of people

27/03/2014 10:58:14 am: Paul Khum: But the autisum rate has increased in the last 20  years.

27/03/2014 10:58:42 am: Paul Khum: Not directly related with immunisation. But it's still a mystery why it's increasing

27/03/2014 10:59:29 am: Khemarint Son: I will read.up on that

27/03/2014 10:59:43 am: Paul Khum: Well send you some links at work

27/03/2014 11:12:53 am: Paul Khum: However I do not believe in "mandatory vaccination" of new vaccines

27/03/2014 11:15:13 am: Paul Khum: Pon I've sent you the links as well.

27/03/2014 11:18:34 am: Khemarint Son: Can u refute this statement with any source

27/03/2014 11:19:29 am: Khemarint Son: There is.absolutely no scientific. Evidence.to.support vscinations link.to autism

27/03/2014 11:19:41 am: Paul Khum: No I can't

27/03/2014 11:19:50 am: Paul Khum: Stright up I can't refute it

27/03/2014 11:21:28 am: Khemarint Son: Withdrawn

27/03/2014 11:24:30 am: Paul Khum: The study wouldn't even be done. This goes back who controls the media, and what will get published and what won't

27/03/2014 11:25:23 am: Khemarint Son: That's Tue study u spoke of when

27/03/2014 11:25:57 am: Khemarint Son: Referring.to.kids getting.autism.straight aftrr injecgions

27/03/2014 11:26:40 am: Khemarint Son: Read about it

27/03/2014 11:26:46 am: Khemarint Son: The study wqs wideley condemned

27/03/2014 11:27:07 am: Khemarint Son: Maniupupatd.data.etc

27/03/2014 11:27:14 am: Khemarint Son: Manipulated

27/03/2014 11:28:07 am: Paul Khum: It would be condemned cause who has more to lose? The pharmaceutical companies who make billion of dollars a year

27/03/2014 11:29:13 am: Paul Khum: Guys we can't believe everything  we are told. We need to question it.

27/03/2014 11:29:55 am: Khemarint Son: Read the wiki I emailed u

27/03/2014 11:30:11 am: Khemarint Son: It's an entire.page.dedicated to.thst.vacinnr

27/03/2014 11:30:17 am: Khemarint Son: With sources!

27/03/2014 11:58:48 am: Paul Khum: Reading it now. Some of the sources do not even relate to the point that they are making.

27/03/2014 11:59:18 am: Paul Khum: E. G source number 16

27/03/2014 11:59:39 am: Paul Khum: Hmm interesting.....

27/03/2014 12:02:21 pm: Paul Khum: I will continue reading this. Will let you know if I find any anomalies

27/03/2014 12:10:01 pm: Paul Khum: Anyone here a organ donor? I would advise against it

27/03/2014 12:45:10 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Sorry no time to read...

Is this another debate bout organ donor?

27/03/2014 12:45:53 pm: Paul Khum: Nah just wondering if you guys were

27/03/2014 12:52:40 pm: Khemarint Son: Why do u advise against it

27/03/2014 12:52:46 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Not going to comment.  But would like to hear why u would advice against ur

27/03/2014 12:52:47 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: It

27/03/2014 12:53:04 pm: Khemarint Son: I am.neutral on.the topic.atm

27/03/2014 12:53:31 pm: Paul Khum: Nah I'm against it lol

27/03/2014 12:54:57 pm: Khemarint Son: Yeah why

27/03/2014 12:55:43 pm: Paul Khum: Alright say you get into a car accident right? (God forbid)
And you get pulled into the E. R.
Now the doctors and nurses can save you if they work really hard, but.... If they know your a organ donor they won't work as hard to save you...
Why? Because they know that you dying will be able to save another 6 people.

27/03/2014 12:56:24 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Fair enough that's ur reason not to..

27/03/2014 12:56:52 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: But advising ppl not too...

27/03/2014 12:57:32 pm: Paul Khum: Well I advise those who I love.

27/03/2014 12:57:45 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Khems gnna ask U for evidence of ur statement now

27/03/2014 12:57:54 pm: Paul Khum: Because I care for them.

27/03/2014 12:58:10 pm: Paul Khum: But hey if you want to go and be a organ donor... Bro go for gold.

27/03/2014 12:58:34 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: But u could be saving 6 other pols lives if u had no chance

27/03/2014 12:58:52 pm: Paul Khum: You won't know if you have no chance or not

27/03/2014 12:58:58 pm: Paul Khum: The doctor will determine that

27/03/2014 12:59:18 pm: Paul Khum: But by them knowing that your a organ donor they won't be working as hard to save you

27/03/2014 1:00:02 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: This just comes back to... What info do u have to make that claim

27/03/2014 1:00:53 pm: Paul Khum: There isn't and won't be articles on this because it's taboo

27/03/2014 1:01:07 pm: Paul Khum: But I have been told this directly from those working in the medical profession

27/03/2014 1:01:14 pm: Paul Khum: Nurses, doctors

27/03/2014 1:06:03 pm: Khemarint Son: Ya its one of.those.thrnhs.that people.say can happen

27/03/2014 1:06:42 pm: Khemarint Son: It's like urban legends

27/03/2014 1:07:14 pm: Khemarint Son: For me.I can't see any sane doctor or even a person doing.this

27/03/2014 1:07:20 pm: Khemarint Son: Just my.opiobion

27/03/2014 1:08:14 pm: Khemarint Son: Here's an.interesting.discussion -
What if u wernt eliglble for organ donations unless you were an organ donor

27/03/2014 1:08:22 pm: Khemarint Son: Would that change.your mind?

27/03/2014 1:08:31 pm: Khemarint Son: This is Tue case In some.countries

27/03/2014 1:15:03 pm: Paul Khum: Hmm it might change my mind because that would mean the rule is applied universally

27/03/2014 1:17:24 pm: Paul Khum: But it would pose a problem, like of I'm in need of a kidney. Do I need to give up a liver to get that kidney?

27/03/2014 1:17:25 pm: Khemarint Son: Yeah but thr doctor.letting u die.factor is.exactly thr same

27/03/2014 1:17:49 pm: Khemarint Son: No only if u die.then.ur.parts will.br harvedyed

27/03/2014 1:17:51 pm: Khemarint Son: Harvested

27/03/2014 1:18:20 pm: Paul Khum: Hmm I wouldn't say it the exactly the same thing?

27/03/2014 1:19:26 pm: Khemarint Son: Why.not

27/03/2014 1:19:52 pm: Khemarint Son: It's only your oej motivation.that has changed

27/03/2014 1:19:52 pm: Khemarint Son: Your life can.still.save 6 lives

27/03/2014 1:19:52 pm: Khemarint Son: The doctors.motivation.is still the same

27/03/2014 1:21:50 pm: Paul Khum: If the rule is applied to everyone then yes, but no if the rule doesn't apply to everyone

27/03/2014 1:23:32 pm: Khemarint Son: Yes were .saying the law is applied.to.eveeyp e

27/03/2014 1:23:32 pm: Khemarint Son: If.u are a organ donar theb you.are.eligible for organ donations

27/03/2014 1:24:15 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Seriously u never know what's gnna happen. There could be many different reasons. Either u do it or U dont

27/03/2014 1:24:33 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah but the current rule doesn't apply to everyone.

27/03/2014 1:25:06 pm: Paul Khum: Ye that right every situation would be different, but this point in time I'm not a organ donor.

27/03/2014 1:25:29 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: A doctor could not care less about u, donor or not if they were racist...

27/03/2014 1:25:45 pm: Paul Khum: Happy for my organs be harvested when I'm dead. (but I don't want the doctor knowing that)

27/03/2014 1:27:05 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: I'll let them kno!

27/03/2014 1:27:16 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Save 6 lives

27/03/2014 1:27:32 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: They prob take it any way..

27/03/2014 1:31:30 pm: Khemarint Son: Paul did u read.thr links.I sent.to u

27/03/2014 1:31:41 pm: Khemarint Son: One of.them.was.a quote.from a page you sent.me

27/03/2014 1:33:04 pm: Khemarint Son: Refuting.all that vacination claims u had

27/03/2014 1:43:35 pm: Khemarint Son: Also.from.another one.of.your articles

27/03/2014 1:45:35 pm: Khemarint Son: The.increase.in autism " was the result of digonoses of children with previously unrecognised autism"

27/03/2014 1:46:48 pm: Khemarint Son: Even concludes with "if.you look at the numbers and the report inself you'll see overall thr numbers of people being born with autism sent necessarily increasing.dramatically'

27/03/2014 1:47:00 pm: Khemarint Son: That's a quote from.your own Forbes article

27/03/2014 1:47:30 pm: Khemarint Son: Arnt*

27/03/2014 1:53:46 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah I don't believe it though, I know what the Forbes site is saying that we've become better at identifying children who have autisum. But to me it's a cover up of what is really happening

27/03/2014 1:55:02 pm: Paul Khum: As if you wouldn't know your kid was autistic when they're born. What you got a wait for children aged 6 to 13 then suddenly say. "oh hey where being able to determine autistic kids better now..."

27/03/2014 1:55:30 pm: Khemarint Son: It's.not.just that that's what there saying

27/03/2014 1:55:45 pm: Khemarint Son: Sometimes parents.might now.recognise a kid has autism

27/03/2014 1:55:57 pm: Khemarint Son: Whereas before he would.of.been.labeled a dumb.ass

27/03/2014 1:56:10 pm: Khemarint Son: Also now.parents.are.using.it as an excuse.for behaviour

27/03/2014 1:56:33 pm: Khemarint Son: So egen anything remotely asymptomatic

27/03/2014 1:56:36 pm: Khemarint Son: They might shout. Autism

27/03/2014 1:56:54 pm: Khemarint Son: That's just examples of what could cause an inctrwase

27/03/2014 1:57:04 pm: Khemarint Son: I'm.quoting.one.of your sources here

27/03/2014 1:57:17 pm: Paul Khum: Ye I know what you mean, but I don't know I'm still a bit sceptic about it all. Like you would know if your kid was like forest gump

27/03/2014 1:58:37 pm: Khemarint Son: Lol but u take thr skeptical in literally any theory that.goes against.the status quo

27/03/2014 1:59:53 pm: Khemarint Son: Wait I mean

27/03/2014 2:00:37 pm: Khemarint Son: You literally side with all conspiracies or skeptism that are.agsonst thr status quo

27/03/2014 2:01:21 pm: Paul Khum: Hahaha man I need to question everything

27/03/2014 2:01:31 pm: Paul Khum: Yes I am against the status quo if you put it like that

27/03/2014 2:08:53 pm: Marra Lim: Wow, you guys have heaps of down time. I'm getting the shot this Monday. I've had It before,no side effects so I'm gonna have it again.

27/03/2014 2:10:23 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah that's the flu shot marra?

27/03/2014 2:10:31 pm: Paul Khum: Us office guys don't really work

27/03/2014 2:10:44 pm: Paul Khum: Well we work when we want / need to

27/03/2014 2:10:47 pm: Marra Lim: Yeah. It's true, they put shit/rubbish in the syringe which our bodies are designed to fight.

27/03/2014 2:11:00 pm: Marra Lim: Yeah, the flu shot

27/03/2014 2:11:17 pm: Paul Khum: They also out mercury in the shot as preservative as well

27/03/2014 2:11:45 pm: Paul Khum: Look I'm just sceptic by nature.... I need to question everything.
I'll give you a example.....

27/03/2014 2:11:57 pm: Marra Lim: Does anyone know the age kids can get it?

27/03/2014 2:12:07 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Ur a pain in the ass

27/03/2014 2:12:46 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: But it's good to question things .

27/03/2014 2:13:13 pm: Paul Khum: My mate was on a porn cam website.. Where the girls are on camera performing live for you..... I didn't believe that the girls were really live, and I thought it was all pre recorded...

27/03/2014 2:14:17 pm: Marra Lim: I understand the skepticism but its a little excessive not to for religious reasons.

27/03/2014 2:14:52 pm: Paul Khum: So I told him... "man that's Bs! If it's real tell the bitch to put 3 fingers up..... (in the air)"
After he types it in the chat.... Then he got booted out of the channel. Lol!

27/03/2014 2:15:24 pm: Marra Lim: Lol.

27/03/2014 2:16:56 pm: Paul Khum: And come on marra as if you don't have any down time with your work. Lol

27/03/2014 2:17:14 pm: Paul Khum: When you going for your run marra?

27/03/2014 2:22:03 pm: Marra Lim: 5pm , soon. At my last pick up

27/03/2014 2:28:51 pm: Paul Khum: Shouldn't you go back to the depo after your last pick up at 5pm?😜

27/03/2014 3:33:05 pm: Marra Lim: Should , but that's my lunch break

27/03/2014 11:22:25 pm: Terry So: Here's my credible source for the autism debate

http://howdovaccinescauseautism.com/

27/03/2014 11:35:33 pm: Paul Khum: You a organ donor terry?

27/03/2014 11:40:55 pm: Paul Khum: Alright the vaccine debate came about cause I heard it on the radio. (2GB) But it was funny cause they had two callers and it went like this.
Caller1 "How dare you try and enforce my kids to be immunised, it's against my religion and my kids are healthy without any vaccinations. "
Host 'well if your kids get one of the other kids sick and they die, it's in your head......the link with autism is wrong'
Caller 2" I'd prefer my child be autistic than dead...... He is vaccinated.... And he is autistic...... "

27/03/2014 11:45:26 pm: Paul Khum: But question, if your kid was immunised and they didn't encounter someone sick, wouldn't they be immuned to it?

27/03/2014 11:50:22 pm: Paul Khum: And really who here is a organ donor? I already told you guys I'm not.... 😷🏥

28/03/2014 7:19:40 am: Khemarint Son: U heard it.om.the radio.and.u didn't read anythimg.on it??

28/03/2014 7:19:57 am: Khemarint Son: Even.the sources.u linked ne refuted your claims

28/03/2014 7:20:10 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Haha..

28/03/2014 7:20:40 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Don't waste ur time on Paul's    Debates

28/03/2014 7:46:53 am: Paul Khum: I've read about it and heard it from other sources as well.

28/03/2014 7:47:17 am: Paul Khum: The sources I linked it's a mere cover up

28/03/2014 7:48:40 am: Paul Khum: Man think about it, why would people even say there is a adverse affect with the vaccine if there wasn't? Surely these people are concern about their child welfare or have had their child then retarded as a result of it.

28/03/2014 7:50:43 am: Khemarint Son: Could these people.have incorrectly made.the link?

28/03/2014 7:50:51 am: Paul Khum: Heaps of cases have been reported in the USA. But when a parent comes out with it, what happens? They become outcast, demonised about what their saying.

28/03/2014 7:51:17 am: Khemarint Son: Using.terrys.example

28/03/2014 7:51:27 am: Khemarint Son: Everyone drinks.coke.gets.cancer

28/03/2014 7:51:34 am: Paul Khum: May be, I'm not ruling it out. But this many cases?

28/03/2014 7:51:42 am: Khemarint Son: Shit that means coke gives u.cancer ?

28/03/2014 7:52:00 am: Khemarint Son: Where's your many.sourcesm?

28/03/2014 7:52:09 am: Khemarint Son: Even the ones.you linked.agreed.with me.!!!!

28/03/2014 7:53:39 am: Khemarint Son: Correation does.not equal causation

28/03/2014 7:53:46 am: Paul Khum: Dude it might! Coke may very well give you cancer

28/03/2014 7:53:49 am: Khemarint Son: Correlation*

28/03/2014 7:54:13 am: Khemarint Son: U know.airbags.cause.deaths ??

28/03/2014 7:54:43 am: Paul Khum: Yrah I've been told they kill more then they save

28/03/2014 7:54:56 am: Khemarint Son: That's.a.false.stat

28/03/2014 7:54:57 am: Khemarint Son: Lol

28/03/2014 7:55:09 am: Khemarint Son: I beg.you to even.try find a source.on that

28/03/2014 7:55:47 am: Paul Khum: Guys you are living in the matrix man. The twilight zone.

28/03/2014 7:55:48 am: Paul Khum: I'm Morpheus trying to wake you up

28/03/2014 7:57:34 am: Paul Khum: My theory is that you may not be able to find any sources on it cause its all covered up by the pharmaceutical companies, who make billion of dollars every year.

28/03/2014 7:57:36 am: Paul Khum: Who have a vested interest not to let this information be linked out.

28/03/2014 7:58:02 am: Paul Khum: Question everything and trust no one.

28/03/2014 7:58:38 am: Ponnorraks Ou: That last point is ur biggest problem

28/03/2014 7:58:55 am: Paul Khum: You guys still believe that terrorist attacks are a real treat? You got more chances of dying in a car accident then a terrorist. But the media doesn't tell you that.

28/03/2014 7:59:19 am: Paul Khum: Which one? I've written a few things Lol

28/03/2014 8:00:35 am: Ponnorraks Ou: "Question everything and trust no one"

28/03/2014 8:01:05 am: Khemarint Son: Funny.tying.is

28/03/2014 8:01:34 am: Paul Khum: Pon, did people question what the Khmer rough was doing? Or what Hitler was doing with the Jews?

28/03/2014 8:01:46 am: Paul Khum: Before it was too late?

28/03/2014 8:01:49 am: Khemarint Son: U yourself believe the media which attacks or questions everything

28/03/2014 8:02:03 am: Khemarint Son: Iiterally every single.conspiracy u have

28/03/2014 8:03:21 am: Khemarint Son: But.when. we present.to.you some evidence.

28/03/2014 8:03:24 am: Khemarint Son: U go quiet

28/03/2014 8:03:39 am: Khemarint Son: Same.as.when we.present cold hard.facts

28/03/2014 8:03:41 am: Khemarint Son: U go quiet

28/03/2014 8:04:00 am: Khemarint Son: Or when.we.ask u for some.sources

28/03/2014 8:04:14 am: Khemarint Son: Coz.u know.your sources.are. shonky.

28/03/2014 8:04:20 am: Khemarint Son: Lol

28/03/2014 8:05:46 am: Khemarint Son: Or non existent

28/03/2014 8:06:05 am: Paul Khum: I believe the media gad other vested interest that it needs to protect

28/03/2014 8:06:31 am: Khemarint Son: We have.the internet.

28/03/2014 8:06:42 am: Khemarint Son: All.your.conspiracies. are on there

28/03/2014 8:07:03 am: Paul Khum: I'm not saying that yeah its all 100%, that is gospel. But to keep a open mind to the that these things could be happening

28/03/2014 8:07:26 am: Khemarint Son: But u don't.have.an.open mind

28/03/2014 8:07:43 am: Paul Khum: Theyre only conspiracy cause they haven't been fully came out with the truth.

28/03/2014 8:07:45 am: Khemarint Son: Lol

28/03/2014 8:08:00 am: Paul Khum: How don't I? I'm questioning it

28/03/2014 8:08:31 am: Ponnorraks Ou: I think u have problems more closer to home to worry bout rather than worrying about the world

28/03/2014 8:08:40 am: Paul Khum: You guys are just saying I'm flat out a conspiracy nut

28/03/2014 8:10:23 am: Khemarint Son: Basically any.conspracy is true even.when presented with evidence.to thr contrary

28/03/2014 8:10:27 am: Paul Khum: Man its not like I'm here worrying about the world. I'm listening to Fucken 2gb radio here, forums online.

28/03/2014 8:10:29 am: Khemarint Son: That's close minded.

28/03/2014 8:11:53 am: Paul Khum: Pon my problems at home wouldn't be solved if I just worried about it, there a work in progress

28/03/2014 8:14:21 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Everything is work in progress.
You're more worried Bout USA going to war, things that we can't help

28/03/2014 8:17:15 am: Ponnorraks Ou: .. Don't get immunised, advise not to donor is pretty much being minded

28/03/2014 8:17:40 am: Paul Khum: I'm not worried about it more so than my personal issues. Just forwarding on things that are happening in current events that main stream don't cover

28/03/2014 8:18:31 am: Paul Khum: Pon there's a saying. "those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it"

28/03/2014 8:18:54 am: Paul Khum: All I'm trying to do is forward on messages that I hear

28/03/2014 8:19:16 am: Khemarint Son: So will your kid.get thr mmr.vacination?

28/03/2014 8:19:47 am: Paul Khum: Cuz what benefit do I get from telling you? Nothing. Man go on the donor listing then. It might benefit me anyway cause some of you here may be my blood type. Lol

28/03/2014 8:19:57 am: Paul Khum: Yeah I probably will khem

28/03/2014 8:20:10 am: Paul Khum: I'm I scared of any adverse reactions that they  might have from it? Fuck yes

28/03/2014 8:20:24 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Nah it's definately great to hear bout things going on around the world. I'm interested.

28/03/2014 8:21:03 am: Khemarint Son: Why would u get thr vacinatiom then.

28/03/2014 8:22:00 am: Ponnorraks Ou: It's when u go that extra step to say these things are definately happening without any solid evidence

28/03/2014 8:22:45 am: Khemarint Son: Ya I agree with pon

28/03/2014 8:23:02 am: Khemarint Son: And don't accept any evidence that refutes.your statements

28/03/2014 8:28:31 am: Paul Khum: No I said there's a chance of this happening

28/03/2014 8:29:00 am: Paul Khum: Khem I agreed with your email yesterday that the UK nail article may have been a one of case

28/03/2014 8:29:21 am: Paul Khum: *UK mail

28/03/2014 9:38:22 am: Khemarint Son: That was a very.minor.point of.my.email

My thoughts more agreed with terry in.that these distraught.parents are just tryijg to explain.their chikds autism so

28/03/2014 9:38:33 am: Khemarint Son: They blame it.on thr vacinne

28/03/2014 9:38:48 am: Khemarint Son: The question about it being.an isolated case was more rhetoric

28/03/2014 9:39:24 am: Paul Khum: Yeah but surely if he was already autistic prior to the vaccination. The defendants (pharmaceutical company) would of tried to prove that to avoid paying damages?

28/03/2014 9:39:57 am: Khemarint Son: It's.not a pharm company paying

28/03/2014 9:40:03 am: Khemarint Son: Please.read the article again

28/03/2014 9:40:13 am: Paul Khum: I already said previously that yes I do believe in vaccines which have a proven track record. However what I don't agree with is compulsory / enforcement of vaccination

28/03/2014 9:40:19 am: Khemarint Son: It's the Italian government

28/03/2014 9:40:29 am: Paul Khum: Or who ever had to pay the damages

28/03/2014 9:40:56 am: Khemarint Son: But all.your arguements.were based om the mmr.vacine

28/03/2014 9:41:08 am: Khemarint Son: All.of.your statements.have.centered.around.it.

28/03/2014 9:41:51 am: Khemarint Son: Gotta open up your mind cuz

28/03/2014 9:41:53 am: Paul Khum: Ye cause that's main one that has been in the spot light most recently

28/03/2014 9:42:09 am: Paul Khum: Lol how I'm I not?

28/03/2014 9:42:24 am: Paul Khum: Don't think you your not being opened minded by just dismissing these claims?

28/03/2014 9:42:25 am: Khemarint Son: Not recently
Since. 1998

28/03/2014 9:42:34 am: Khemarint Son: U don't accept any.evidence

28/03/2014 9:42:46 am: Khemarint Son: But.choose.to only.believe.nitpicked news.and.sources

28/03/2014 9:42:56 am: Khemarint Son: And I've caught.u out on them

28/03/2014 9:43:08 am: Paul Khum: The case and articles were writen in 2013

28/03/2014 9:43:56 am: Khemarint Son: Yeah but i showed u Tue article whicu refuted it.

28/03/2014 9:44:00 am: Paul Khum: No I have you articles for both sides of the argument. I could of easily just sent articles writen which supported what I was saying

28/03/2014 9:44:10 am: Khemarint Son: They made a connection just.because.it.was.named.in.the same.stilldy

28/03/2014 9:44:21 am: Khemarint Son: U did

28/03/2014 9:44:22 am: Khemarint Son: And I.countered.

28/03/2014 9:44:32 am: Khemarint Son: Feel free to show.me.more

28/03/2014 9:45:05 am: Paul Khum: Lol okay will do

28/03/2014 9:45:45 am: Khemarint Son: Again.all.the articles u showed are.about mmr

28/03/2014 9:45:56 am: Paul Khum: Look I'm not all gains this vaccination. I posed the questions "hey guys what do you you think about variations which may have a adverse affect the on your kid"

28/03/2014 9:45:57 am: Khemarint Son: This is The main.one people argue.about.

28/03/2014 9:46:28 am: Paul Khum: Yes cause it could be that it's the only one of concerns. All the other vaccines may all be solid

28/03/2014 9:46:54 am: Khemarint Son: This is one where.thr science is conlusive

28/03/2014 9:47:08 am: Khemarint Son: There's.not even one.that.demonstrated.otherwise

28/03/2014 9:47:38 am: Paul Khum: I'm not advocating against the MMR, but merely questioning the fact that people have come out blaming that their children have had a adverse affect on it

28/03/2014 9:48:10 am: Khemarint Son: Its.hard to.discuss with u dismiss any sources except.those.which agre with you

28/03/2014 9:48:22 am: Paul Khum: You probably won't be hearing any more cases of it streaming up. Most parents don't have the financial backing to fight it.

28/03/2014 9:49:15 am: Paul Khum: Didn't I agree with your point that it could of been a isolated case?

28/03/2014 9:50:19 am: Khemarint Son: That.wasn't my.point

28/03/2014 9:50:39 am: Khemarint Son: Well.just.have.to agree to.disagree

28/03/2014 9:50:53 am: Khemarint Son: Feel.free.to.show me any updates on thr topic.tho

28/03/2014 9:51:00 am: Paul Khum: Now the organ doner thing is a different story. We're not ever going to hear of anyone in the medical profession coming out and saying they don't try 100% to save someone. Cause it just goes against there code of conduct

28/03/2014 9:51:09 am: Paul Khum: Haha yeah agreed

28/03/2014 9:51:25 am: Paul Khum: But I'm still a bit sus about the whole MMR thing.

28/03/2014 9:51:49 am: Paul Khum: Hahaha will do cuz

28/03/2014 12:48:07 pm: Terry So: The donor story CAN happen. It's a moral dilemma for the doctor and team to choose to do that if they wish without you knowing. But I do not think that if the situation were to happen, that the majority of doctors would do it.

An analogy would be when Paul Khum is doing his work and would rather do other work because in his eyes, it was a bigger priority.

Just depends on who you get but yeah, I'm an organ donor.

28/03/2014 12:48:24 pm: Terry So: "Question everything and trust no one?"

28/03/2014 12:49:14 pm: Terry So: Might as well get you a tin fool hat to go with it.

28/03/2014 12:50:36 pm: Paul Khum: Hahaha yeah if you got one pass it over

28/03/2014 12:52:14 pm: Paul Khum: I'd be wearing a helmet like magneto if I could find one

28/03/2014 1:46:35 pm: Paul Khum: You guys really think Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction? Which is what lead to the invasion of Iraq? Killing 1million civilians?

28/03/2014 1:47:18 pm: Khemarint Son: No comment

28/03/2014 1:49:14 pm: Paul Khum: You can  only purchase oil by using usd$ from the Arab countries. Whether your buying or selling oil it needs to be done using usd$ currency. Saddam Hussein wanted to change this so you could use euro$ or even gold. The USA wasn't happened with this.....

28/03/2014 1:49:29 pm: Paul Khum: They never found any weapons of mass destruction

28/03/2014 1:51:21 pm: Paul Khum: You just can't trust everything  that your told

28/03/2014 1:56:17 pm: Khemarint Son: Chinese sold oil.in their currency

28/03/2014 1:56:32 pm: Khemarint Son: But we won't get into another.conspiracy debate today

28/03/2014 1:56:50 pm: Paul Khum: Haha Nah enough for today

28/03/2014 1:57:17 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: For this financial year

28/03/2014 1:58:04 pm: Paul Khum: Speaking of China, there's been a economic forecast made that their going to be going into a crisis.

28/03/2014 1:58:10 pm: Paul Khum: But let's leave it at that

28/03/2014 1:58:24 pm: Paul Khum: Hahaha no worries, so I can start again in roughly 3 months

28/03/2014 2:01:37 pm: Paul Khum: <image omitted>

28/03/2014 2:04:44 pm: Paul Khum: Should we be like Arnold today? It's Friday!

28/03/2014 4:39:55 pm: Paul Khum: <image omitted>

28/03/2014 4:41:38 pm: Paul Khum: Beer o clock boys, man you guys are no fun.... So serious.

28/03/2014 4:42:37 pm: Paul Khum: All that conspiracy talk got you all serious.

28/03/2014 6:20:15 pm: Terry So: If one plus one equals two, I can't sit idly by and let you think the answer is purple.

28/03/2014 6:39:45 pm: Paul Khum: Wtf I thought 1 + 1 = windows?

28/03/2014 6:42:52 pm: Paul Khum: Nah appreciate your input terry. And khem. Unlike pon and marra, just sitting on the side line.

28/03/2014 6:47:56 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: I find debating with u pointless

28/03/2014 6:51:11 pm: Marra Lim: Sometimes I'm a fence sitter

28/03/2014 6:51:15 pm: Marra Lim: <image omitted>

28/03/2014 6:51:42 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: WTf

28/03/2014 6:52:29 pm: Paul Khum: Fuck talk about a pain in the ass!

28/03/2014 7:01:12 pm: Marra Lim: I thought it was funny. I can probably guess what she was up to .

28/03/2014 7:02:55 pm: Khemarint Son: Could be a guy

28/03/2014 7:02:55 pm: Khemarint Son: Lol

28/03/2014 7:18:04 pm: Marra Lim: The guy has a nice ass

28/03/2014 8:03:22 pm: Paul Khum: Nah man, I'm sure your ass is nicer than that marra

31/03/2014 6:35:00 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Just saw my neighbour, and remembered her name.
Jen Luong

Not sure how u can find her.. Facebook?

31/03/2014 6:43:31 pm: Marra Lim: Lol, lets get acquainted

31/03/2014 6:43:33 pm: Marra Lim: http://mycreditfile.com.au/

31/03/2014 6:44:13 pm: Marra Lim: Khem, I remember this discussion a while back. Apparently you get 1 free credit file. Use at your own risk.

31/03/2014 6:44:40 pm: Marra Lim: David Grafton promotes this site.

31/03/2014 6:46:20 pm: Khemarint Son: Don't.need.it.

31/03/2014 6:46:30 pm: Khemarint Son: I registered ffor sms service

31/03/2014 6:46:40 pm: Khemarint Son: Any.changes.to my.credit file I get an SMS.

31/03/2014 6:46:58 pm: Khemarint Son: This is a fraud measure after my incident.

31/03/2014 6:49:56 pm: Marra Lim: Is It free?

31/03/2014 6:50:14 pm: Khemarint Son: Nah its like 50 a year

31/03/2014 6:50:19 pm: Khemarint Son: Or sumthng

31/03/2014 6:50:32 pm: Khemarint Son: For me.its worth the piece.of mind

31/03/2014 6:51:01 pm: Marra Lim: Ok, it's worth it. I want to learn more. Which company you go through?

31/03/2014 6:51:11 pm: Marra Lim: Your bank?

31/03/2014 6:52:45 pm: Khemarint Son: I think my.credit.file.and veta. Are the same company

31/03/2014 6:52:47 pm: Khemarint Son: Ill.check.this.

31/03/2014 6:52:49 pm: Khemarint Son: Later

31/03/2014 6:53:30 pm: Marra Lim: Ok. Thanks

31/03/2014 7:07:46 pm: Paul Khum: Veda it is.

31/03/2014 7:09:31 pm: Marra Lim: Even though you guys don't follow league. A bloke who plays for Newcastle: alex mckinnon is a quadriplegic. News just came through. So I'm questioning if its true or not .

31/03/2014 7:10:00 pm: Marra Lim: That's neck down. Watch all the parents take their kids out of league now.

31/03/2014 7:11:35 pm: Paul Khum: Is this why there talking about changing the rules, so only 2 men can only tackle at one time? In suppose to 3 men.

31/03/2014 7:12:44 pm: Khemarint Son: Nah I.think.that.was more of a pacing.issue.

31/03/2014 7:12:51 pm: Khemarint Son: it.slowed.down the game

31/03/2014 7:13:01 pm: Khemarint Son: But damn.Marta that is a sad story.

31/03/2014 7:14:32 pm: Paul Khum: Is it? Heard it was more of a safety issue. Cause 3 guys would generally cause more damage with a tackle than 2 guys.... But yeah very sad man. Nrl has always been seen as a violet game

31/03/2014 7:14:36 pm: Marra Lim: Yeah, it's real sad if its true. I love watching the game. But not seeing shit like this. I hope it's not true.

31/03/2014 7:15:04 pm: Khemarint Son: I don't think.Nrl.is.that.vpilet.tbh

31/03/2014 7:15:08 pm: Khemarint Son: vioent.

31/03/2014 7:15:14 pm: Marra Lim: There are some blokes weighing 120kg. Running at pace. You need 3 blokes to stop them

31/03/2014 7:15:17 pm: Khemarint Son: Compare it.to the.nNFL

31/03/2014 7:15:30 pm: Khemarint Son: They.have.big studies.on.brain damage of.ex.NFL players

31/03/2014 7:15:32 pm: Marra Lim: I hope he sues the NRL .

31/03/2014 7:15:35 pm: Khemarint Son: Some.serious shitn

31/03/2014 7:15:55 pm: Marra Lim: It's not worthit for other people's entertainment .

31/03/2014 7:32:14 pm: Paul Khum: Abit of coin but playing I'm the Nrl. Would they be getting paid more than ufc players?

31/03/2014 7:32:20 pm: Paul Khum: Or fighters I might say

31/03/2014 7:44:32 pm: Marra Lim: NRL is bigger at the moment. UFC is growing though

31/03/2014 8:49:21 pm: Khemarint Son: Nah pretty sure ufc is way bigger

31/03/2014 8:49:23 pm: Khemarint Son: Australia market is.small

31/03/2014 8:49:53 pm: Paul Khum: I don't like ufc, I feel like it's too barbaric

31/03/2014 8:51:57 pm: Paul Khum: But what about the pay? Who would be paid more. A ufc fighter or a Nrl player?

31/03/2014 10:03:40 pm: Marra Lim: I guess UFC, only because its international and their product reaches a wider audience.

31/03/2014 10:04:37 pm: Marra Lim: Hence they get more advertising exposure which is what pays them.

31/03/2014 10:05:15 pm: Paul Khum: I thought Nrl would be paid more

31/03/2014 10:06:12 pm: Marra Lim: That's why they talk a lot of shit before a fight. NRL press conference are not that interesting

31/03/2014 10:07:33 pm: Paul Khum: Nrl players are just a bunch of gladiators

31/03/2014 11:03:38 pm: Khemarint Son: Its diff coz Nrl has.salaries

31/03/2014 11:03:49 pm: Khemarint Son: Ufc ggets.paid.per.fight.

31/03/2014 11:03:54 pm: Khemarint Son: the higher.you move.up.the more.pay

31/03/2014 11:04:07 pm: Khemarint Son: But you.get bonsues.if.u are.popular.

31/03/2014 11:35:02 pm: Terry So: According to mma-manifesto.com(2012 salaries),

1: Jon jones $865k
2: rashad Evans $710k

31/03/2014 11:51:45 pm: Terry So: According to nrl.com(2014),

-$5.5m salary cap
-minimum wage of $77.5k

1/04/2014 8:08:14 am: Marra Lim: Things like boxing/ UFC/ solo sports are a pretty lonely world. And a lot of their training require heaps of alone time.

6/04/2014 8:40:56 pm: Marra Lim: So you use honey instead .

7/04/2014 10:47:06 am: Khemarint Son: Nah just warehouse I think

7/04/2014 10:47:13 am: Khemarint Son: Online retailer

7/04/2014 10:47:20 am: Khemarint Son: But shipping is pretty quick already

7/04/2014 10:51:14 am: Paul Khum: Oh okay, yeah I've checked out this website and few times before. And checking it out now. I felt the price were still relatively similar / still expensive for a online retailer.

7/04/2014 10:51:22 am: Khemarint Son: Wait for sales

7/04/2014 10:51:29 am: Khemarint Son: Since they come quite often

7/04/2014 10:51:55 am: Paul Khum: Alright sweet. Yeah I want some new jeans.

7/04/2014 10:52:20 am: Paul Khum: Let me google it to see what's involved... But probably not.

7/04/2014 10:52:55 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Why not. U we're going to sign up for spartan !

7/04/2014 10:53:20 am: Paul Khum: Yeah that's next year but

7/04/2014 10:53:30 am: Paul Khum: Need time to prep up Lol.

7/04/2014 11:01:23 am: Khemarint Son: This one's harder I think

7/04/2014 11:01:44 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Team work!

7/04/2014 11:01:56 am: Paul Khum: Man approximately  8 kms....

7/04/2014 11:18:22 am: Paul Khum: Nah fuck that. This one looks really hard.

7/04/2014 11:21:24 am: Paul Khum: I think rope climbing would be the hardest one for me

7/04/2014 11:23:29 am: Khemarint Son: I did rope climb for the first time on sat

7/04/2014 11:23:32 am: Khemarint Son: Smashed it

7/04/2014 11:23:55 am: Khemarint Son: It's all in the technique (using ur legs)

7/04/2014 11:24:57 am: Paul Khum: Really? I've never done it before. It looks hard.

7/04/2014 11:26:48 am: Khemarint Son: Yeah u could do it now even

7/04/2014 11:27:20 am: Khemarint Son: U use ur legs to grip the rope

7/04/2014 11:27:56 am: Khemarint Son: Boisan almost got up

7/04/2014 11:29:46 am: Terry So: Yeah, squeeze your feet against the rope

7/04/2014 11:30:24 am: Paul Khum: I thought it used a lot of upper body. Like when you do chin ups.

7/04/2014 11:30:30 am: Terry So: I heard in the army, you hook the rope around your feet and it sort of creates a platform for you

9/04/2014 10:48:42 am: Terry So: You'd only forward it to us if you enjoy it. Do you enjoy old men porn?

9/04/2014 11:28:29 am: Terry So: huffingtonpost.com/jennifer-raff/dear-parents-you-are-being-lied-to-about-vaccines_b_5112620.html

9/04/2014 11:28:51 am: Terry So: An article for the skeptic, Paul khum.

9/04/2014 11:38:25 am: Paul Khum: It's Paul Lim 😉

9/04/2014 11:41:50 am: Paul Khum: I'm only sceptic about new vaccines which haven't been around for too long. And sceptic about the government forcing people to be vaccinated.

9/04/2014 11:43:04 am: Terry So: It's reasoning is in the article

9/04/2014 11:43:25 am: Paul Khum: Speaking of which comes to a question that I posed earlier.
If your child wasn't vaccinated. How would you child get another child sick? Shouldn't vaccinated kids be immune to the virus/disease?

9/04/2014 11:43:56 am: Terry So: Read the article

9/04/2014 11:44:14 am: Terry So: Even has links for each section you don't understand

9/04/2014 11:44:20 am: Khemarint Son: Vaccination doesn't protect against it all

9/04/2014 11:44:31 am: Khemarint Son: Viruses are always changing

9/04/2014 11:44:35 am: Khemarint Son: Ur body also changes

9/04/2014 11:44:56 am: Terry So: Hence the yearly flu shot

9/04/2014 11:45:07 am: Khemarint Son: Exactly

9/04/2014 11:46:16 am: Terry So: Like when you go Cambo ten year ago, and go now, you new another shot of whatever it is cause the virus changes.

9/04/2014 11:46:21 am: Khemarint Son: So kids that don't have the vacinstion give breeding ground to create a stronger virus

9/04/2014 11:47:42 am: Khemarint Son: Paul u say ur only sceptic about new vaccines but literally all your arguments and examples were about the Mmr virus

9/04/2014 11:48:01 am: Khemarint Son: Lol

9/04/2014 11:48:32 am: Khemarint Son: Which has been around for years

9/04/2014 11:57:02 am: Paul Khum: Isn't there some vaccine that you only take one? And it's done for life?

9/04/2014 11:57:19 am: Terry So: Measles?

9/04/2014 11:57:44 am: Paul Khum: Hep b as well?

9/04/2014 11:59:24 am: Paul Khum: Fair enough virus are changing, but why would a parent be accountable for getting another child sick. If there kid wasn't vaccinated and the other kid was vaccinate?

9/04/2014 11:59:44 am: Paul Khum: Wouldn't that just mean the vaccine failed to do what it was meant to?

9/04/2014 12:00:36 pm: Paul Khum: If you don't vaccinate yourself or your kid. Wouldn't you only be  putting yourself at risk?

9/04/2014 12:00:55 pm: Terry So: When you go to Thailand, you get a typhoid shot. It reduces the chances but doesn't mean it's 100%.

9/04/2014 12:01:25 pm: Terry So: Khem answered that a few messages ago.

9/04/2014 12:01:39 pm: Paul Khum: Well that's fucked, it should be 100% in my opinion

9/04/2014 12:02:03 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah cause viruses are always changing. Along with your body.

9/04/2014 12:02:07 pm: Terry So: Then you go create it.

9/04/2014 12:02:17 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Damn Paul

9/04/2014 12:02:35 pm: Terry So: Stop complaining about something which saves 3m kids a year.

9/04/2014 12:02:54 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: .. Can't u be happy with a vaccine that helps reduce the chances of someone getting I'll or dying

9/04/2014 12:03:12 pm: Paul Khum: How I'm I complaining? It's questioning what I don't know.

9/04/2014 12:03:47 pm: Paul Khum: I don't know something so I'm gonna look into it and ask you guys.

9/04/2014 12:04:38 pm: Terry So: Have you read that article? It even links you to sources

9/04/2014 12:04:47 pm: Paul Khum: I never said I wasn't happy. I told you guys previously that I've been vaccinated. But Fuck I ain't no doctors

9/04/2014 12:06:12 pm: Paul Khum: Yrah I've read it. (70%) It didn't answer the questions that I had.

9/04/2014 12:06:40 pm: Terry So: Read the rest

9/04/2014 12:17:40 pm: Paul Khum: Alright pretty good read. Taken abit of time out of my job, but worth it lol.

9/04/2014 12:20:34 pm: Paul Khum: If I ever have kids, I will defiantly vaccinated. But Dam if something happenes (knock on wood that it doesn't) Ill be pretty upset 😢

9/04/2014 12:21:00 pm: Paul Khum: <image omitted>

9/04/2014 12:41:26 pm: Paul Khum: Hey next Friday is Patrick's/om nary bday?

9/04/2014 12:42:23 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Yep nx Friday

9/04/2014 12:42:59 pm: Khemarint Son: No u don't put only yourself at risk because u don't have the vacinstion = u give the virus room to mutate and get stronger perse

9/04/2014 12:43:48 pm: Khemarint Son: In USA there have been out breaks of diseases which hasn't been seen in years because of this vacination scare stupidity

9/04/2014 12:44:06 pm: Paul Khum: Oh right, yeah that answers my question.

9/04/2014 12:47:29 pm: Paul Khum: I didn't know that the virus would mutate. I thought it was only HIV /aids that did

9/04/2014 12:49:10 pm: Paul Khum: Or the US government has introduced these diseases back into the public? 😷

9/04/2014 12:52:23 pm: Paul Khum: If a disease hasn't been seen in years. I would of thought that it would of been eradicated?

9/04/2014 12:53:12 pm: Khemarint Son: "Haven't seen" is more a figure of speech

9/04/2014 12:53:21 pm: Khemarint Son: Like out breaks havint been seen

9/04/2014 12:53:29 pm: Khemarint Son: Or it hasn't been an issue

9/04/2014 12:53:32 pm: Khemarint Son: For years

9/04/2014 12:54:05 pm: Paul Khum: Oh ye I got ya.

9/04/2014 1:27:53 pm: Khemarint Son: Had some Mince meat I cooked and sweet potato

9/04/2014 1:29:33 pm: Paul Khum: Dam that's good man. I had a stir fry I packed. But forgot it at home. 😞. Want to eat big today to fuel my legs for gym. But don't know what I should be eating.

9/04/2014 1:53:10 pm: Khemarint Son: Hate forgetting lunch at home

9/04/2014 1:53:28 pm: Khemarint Son: I always put my lunch near my water jug in the fridge so I don't forget it

9/04/2014 1:53:33 pm: Khemarint Son: <image omitted>

9/04/2014 1:56:46 pm: Paul Khum: I was going to go an amore meal at maccas. But opted for a steak sandwich / burger

9/04/2014 2:12:42 pm: Paul Khum: Dam khem, I just read that article on Facebook about Cambodia workers.
Pretty sad stuff.

9/04/2014 2:14:12 pm: Paul Khum: http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/asia-pacific/cambodia/140404/cambodia-garment-workers-US-brands-fainting

9/04/2014 2:16:42 pm: Khemarint Son: Ya never knew Cambodia was in on the textiles

9/04/2014 2:16:47 pm: Khemarint Son: I could be wearing one of the shirts made there

9/04/2014 2:18:04 pm: Paul Khum: Lol you might man. I have a few clothes at home made in Cambodia. But most of the brands are USA  brands.

9/04/2014 2:18:33 pm: Paul Khum: Man the reason why their fainting is they don't have enough money for people food.

9/04/2014 4:14:33 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: <image omitted>

9/04/2014 4:35:44 pm: Paul Khum: Mad! Is this from your dad's personal collection?

9/04/2014 4:37:51 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Gnna do a trivia fund raise.. Have the images on a board and ppl get to guess for a gold coin

9/04/2014 4:38:11 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Apparently that coin says
First king of Cambodia

9/04/2014 4:38:27 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Lebo chick nx to me can speak and read French

9/04/2014 4:39:15 pm: Paul Khum: Really is that the first king of Cambodia? I thought our history dated back longer than 1860?

9/04/2014 4:43:26 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: He's prob the first king the French put in place

9/04/2014 4:53:04 pm: Paul Khum: Oh yeah true... Cambodia doesn't use coins any more do they?

9/04/2014 4:53:23 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Don't think so?

9/04/2014 4:53:40 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: I rekn their currency will cease to exist one day

9/04/2014 4:53:49 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: They're all using USD

9/04/2014 4:54:08 pm: Khemarint Son: No coins

9/04/2014 4:54:24 pm: Khemarint Son: Use riel for their "coins"  since its worth so little

9/04/2014 4:54:28 pm: Paul Khum: Haha yeah its mixed isn't it? Like you give $5 usd you would get some usd along with cambo $

9/04/2014 4:54:57 pm: Paul Khum: And it's 6,000 cambo to $1 usd? Or something like that

9/04/2014 4:55:15 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: 4000

9/04/2014 4:56:06 pm: Paul Khum: Dam that's alright, abit better than 6000

9/04/2014 4:59:48 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah if the usd$ continues to fall. I don't know how that would affect Cambodia.

14/04/2014 10:09:27 am: Khemarint Son: I prefer the natural one (not because of any health bs)  but because of the smooth oily mess

14/04/2014 10:09:52 am: Ponnorraks Ou: I'm just eating my one coz Khem suggested It

14/04/2014 10:19:27 am: Paul Khum: Yeah the colour looks different. All good. I'm only eating this one cause work provides it.

14/04/2014 10:20:05 am: Paul Khum: Hey what you guys think of the ribs yesterday? I don't normally eat ribs when I go out. Don't know what to compare them to.

14/04/2014 10:34:34 am: Khemarint Son: For 15

14/04/2014 10:34:36 am: Ponnorraks Ou: I normally only eat ribs at hurricanes

14/04/2014 10:51:21 am: Terry So: I think it's because Christians/Jews didn't celebrate it. Hence why they don't.

14/04/2014 10:51:44 am: Terry So: I always thought it was a commercial thing.

14/04/2014 10:54:23 am: Paul Khum: Yeah it is a commercial thing.
It kinda that bday originates to pagan regions.

14/04/2014 11:11:10 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Fair enough. Ye just curious.
I have confirmed that they've even invited for this Friday

14/04/2014 11:15:42 am: Paul Khum: Yeah there's a history behind the origins of bday. Same with the whole deal with not eating pork.

14/04/2014 1:23:09 pm: Khemarint Son: I've tried lamb it's nice too but very fatty so u might not like it

14/04/2014 1:27:43 pm: Terry So: I heard the pork thing is due to pigs being dirty animals.

14/04/2014 1:28:33 pm: Terry So: Yeah, I usually go for pork ribs. I don't think I have a favorite ribs place yet

14/04/2014 1:28:41 pm: Paul Khum: Dam I thought lamb would have less fat.

14/04/2014 1:28:51 pm: Paul Khum: What pork thing?

14/04/2014 1:28:58 pm: Khemarint Son: Nah lamb is fat as he'll!

Chophouse = wynyard(Bligh st)

14/04/2014 1:30:59 pm: Khemarint Son: Ah I see

14/04/2014 1:31:20 pm: Terry So: But they're not full racks. It's one big rib but I haven't had anything as good a the hartsyard one.

14/04/2014 1:55:16 pm: Terry So: I like the one at snag stand. Charlie and co do it pretty well too with the truffles and stuff but I still prefer snag stand since it's cheaper and have better sauce

14/04/2014 2:10:35 pm: Paul Khum: Alright ill have to defiantly try that place out.

14/04/2014 4:59:47 pm: Paul Khum: Haha sure pon.... Online...

14/04/2014 5:00:54 pm: Paul Khum: Man jen would think the same. Jen thinks I like white girls cause a lot of my friends send me pics of white girls. And it didn't help that saj (Khems mate) said he would prefer a white girl on Friday

14/04/2014 5:02:47 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Ive got a whole collection of hot chic pics..

14/04/2014 5:10:08 pm: Paul Khum: Anna doesn't say anything?

14/04/2014 5:27:52 pm: Terry So: Yeah, she looks good.

14/04/2014 5:47:23 pm: Marra Lim: I don't trust photos. You gotta see them in real life.

14/04/2014 5:48:20 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah preferably with out make up too

14/04/2014 5:48:34 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Trust this one.coz ull never she her in real life

15/04/2014 5:03:07 pm: Paul Khum: *east

15/04/2014 5:03:46 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Yeh if the easy can complain and get a curfew it should also be the conditions for the west

15/04/2014 5:04:16 pm: Khemarint Son: Where is this airport

15/04/2014 5:04:19 pm: Khemarint Son: How far from us

15/04/2014 5:06:28 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Maybe 20kms

15/04/2014 5:06:36 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Badgery creek?

15/04/2014 5:06:44 pm: Paul Khum: Yep

15/04/2014 5:06:50 pm: Paul Khum: Let me get the specs now

15/04/2014 5:06:51 pm: Paul Khum: From google

15/04/2014 5:09:23 pm: Paul Khum: Yep about 17kms from the airport to Khems house

15/04/2014 5:10:24 pm: Khemarint Son: Wow that is close

15/04/2014 5:10:37 pm: Paul Khum: Very

15/04/2014 5:10:46 pm: Paul Khum: Marra could run there

15/04/2014 5:17:37 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Will it be international domestic only

15/04/2014 5:17:50 pm: Khemarint Son: I'd imagine international

15/04/2014 5:17:54 pm: Khemarint Son: But smaller scale

15/04/2014 5:18:02 pm: Khemarint Son: So maybe closer places

15/04/2014 5:18:20 pm: Paul Khum: It would both, international and domestic

15/04/2014 5:18:30 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Be awesome if we can fly back from Asia... And be home in 30mins

15/04/2014 5:19:14 pm: Paul Khum: What you mean be home 30mins? 30mins from our place landing at badgery Creek?

15/04/2014 5:19:29 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: I'm at Alexandria for work .. 10 mins from airport and I don't hear planes

15/04/2014 5:19:52 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Yeh drive from airport home

15/04/2014 5:20:33 pm: Paul Khum: Oh yeah it would be 30mina drive if not less? Currently takes me 15mina to drive to the airport area must traffic might be different

15/04/2014 5:21:06 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Although i was at Lilyfield ... Plane was so low u can almost feel the surrounding vibrating

15/04/2014 5:21:42 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Wats in the airport area now

15/04/2014 5:21:58 pm: Paul Khum: At the moment. Nothing by farm land.

15/04/2014 5:22:55 pm: Paul Khum: See the funny thing is, during the hawke government they purchased this land specially for a second air port.

15/04/2014 5:23:43 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah I was at a house / terrace like in summer Hill area. And the house would vibrate Everytime a plane would go over.

15/04/2014 5:24:19 pm: Paul Khum: Not sure about the flight path and how the houses will be affected.

15/04/2014 5:26:04 pm: Paul Khum: It's abit fucked up. Like the argument is that Western Sydney is being black mailed. Either put up with the second airport. Or we get no infrastructure funding at all 😞

15/04/2014 7:25:35 pm: Terry So: I think marrickville, my friend lived there and every so often, they'd go into silence or pause a movie as the plane flies by.

16/04/2014 9:47:21 am: Paul Khum: <image omitted>

16/04/2014 10:08:51 am: Terry So: 13kms from my house. I don't think the noise will hit us. But let me ask my friend.

16/04/2014 10:10:21 am: Paul Khum: Who's your friend?

16/04/2014 10:11:27 am: Terry So: Friend from primary school. Got his pilot licence. Gave that career up to stay local with his partner.

18/04/2014 8:28:20 am: Ponnorraks Ou: "Oh damn.. Thanks guys. What I've always wanted."

"Also wanna say thanks

22/04/2014 11:44:55 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Anyone got kettle bells?

24/04/2014 9:24:40 am: Marra Lim: My biggest achievement ever

24/04/2014 9:24:46 am: Marra Lim: <image omitted>

24/04/2014 9:25:08 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Congrats

24/04/2014 9:25:18 am: Ponnorraks Ou: I've been here for 5 years too

24/04/2014 9:25:33 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Don't get shit for it tho.. Not until 10

24/04/2014 9:25:39 am: Marra Lim: Nice, they make you do a speech?

24/04/2014 9:26:01 am: Marra Lim: Same, all I get is this frame and a hat

24/04/2014 9:26:02 am: Ponnorraks Ou: 5 is insignificant here

24/04/2014 9:26:14 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Ppl are doing 10.. 20 years here

24/04/2014 9:27:06 am: Marra Lim: Lol, same here. 1 guy has been here over 25 years. It's his only job his ever had

24/04/2014 9:27:57 am: Marra Lim: I reacon it's gonna be rare in the further though, for people to hold long term jobs. Unless its their own business's

24/04/2014 9:31:21 am: Ponnorraks Ou: It's already rare now.
Compared to 10.. 20 years ago

24/04/2014 9:36:31 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Did they give u anythin. Else?

Gift card? Voucher?

24/04/2014 9:49:11 am: Marra Lim: Nothing for 5 years. Only 200 bucks for 10 years service. That's pretty shit. But i might hang around for that.

24/04/2014 9:51:16 am: Marra Lim: Konica Minolta gave out awards/ vouchers/ money  to myself and another college for looking after them while I was working in the office. But the funds got intercepted by management . :( a little bit of corruption at head office.

24/04/2014 9:52:24 am: Ponnorraks Ou: It's probably in ur contract that ur not allowed to accept those things anyway

24/04/2014 9:55:12 am: Marra Lim: Every job comes with it's perks. I don't get much in mine. As long as you have a relationship with your customers, they would usually look after you.

24/04/2014 10:03:16 am: Paul Khum: 5 years is considered quite long in my industry / company. Just a hand full of people are hitting the 10 year mark.

24/04/2014 10:04:02 am: Paul Khum: One chick who works who's been here for 10 years got a fancy hand bag as a gift. Something like 2k up. Nothing full hectic.

24/04/2014 10:04:04 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Yeh  5 years is a long time

24/04/2014 10:04:40 am: Ponnorraks Ou: My 5.. Prob 6 years now, is across 3 different positions

24/04/2014 10:07:08 am: Paul Khum: 5 years is good man. I've actually moved around a lot.

24/04/2014 10:08:19 am: Paul Khum: Marra, how much was this voucher? I don't see why management should stop you from receiving a voucher. Like I can't see it be a conflict of interest or anything.

24/04/2014 10:11:33 am: Paul Khum: You do get perks marra. You get paid over time 👍😉

24/04/2014 10:14:48 am: Paul Khum: Did you get a hat and well?

24/04/2014 10:16:53 am: Marra Lim: Well the sales rep got a 50k bonus. Alone. And everyone that was involved in the phasing of them moving between 2 different freight movers got something. Even managers that had nothing  to do with the process put their hand out and got something

24/04/2014 10:17:34 am: Marra Lim: Yeah, I got a hat. Greatly appreciated

24/04/2014 10:17:54 am: Paul Khum: Lol hey you got a picture frame as well.

24/04/2014 10:18:13 am: Marra Lim: Sales reps at tnt get paid pretty well if they get the good contracts. Buts it's difficult because tnt is an expensive service

24/04/2014 10:18:39 am: Paul Khum: Shit man sales guys get paid the most. The last company I was at the sale manager got more than the CFO.

24/04/2014 10:19:01 am: Marra Lim: Yeah. I believe that

24/04/2014 10:20:37 am: Marra Lim: The sales guy that introduced Apple to TNT is on 100k bonus every year provided that apple stays with tnt. That's not including his base wage and which ever customers he may have to his portfolio.

24/04/2014 10:25:21 am: Marra Lim: But that's just a one off. As Apple is TNT's biggest customer

30/04/2014 5:49:09 pm: Paul Khum: Man Cambodia is fucked up, seriously.....

30/04/2014 5:50:47 pm: Paul Khum: The only thing necrssary for the triumph of evil, is that good men do nothing

30/04/2014 6:43:43 pm: Marra Lim: That's embarrassing. They need education..

30/04/2014 6:44:08 pm: Marra Lim: Civilisation

30/04/2014 6:44:49 pm: Marra Lim: This isn't my truck

30/04/2014 6:44:49 pm: Marra Lim: <image omitted>

1/05/2014 6:28:12 pm: Marra Lim: Anyone watching the Mayweather fight this Sunday. Undercards start from 11am.

1/05/2014 6:29:41 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: The bible says we are slaves to sin

1/05/2014 6:29:53 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: I'm learning from a preacher In ffield

1/05/2014 6:30:47 pm: Marra Lim: But sins are forgiven, so we can do what ever we like.

1/05/2014 6:31:27 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Where r  u watching

1/05/2014 6:31:47 pm: Marra Lim: Yet to decide

1/05/2014 6:32:02 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: I have to be at canley temple for bong Los grandma

1/05/2014 6:32:38 pm: Marra Lim: Ok

1/05/2014 6:36:24 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Are these people paid to speak the words of god?

1/05/2014 6:40:50 pm: Marra Lim: No, they're not. It's their mission. It's an honour for them to speak the word of god. Some subsidies their wage to a certain percentage and give it to their church.

1/05/2014 6:42:55 pm: Marra Lim: Paul might be able to share a lil info about their purpose.

1/05/2014 8:08:40 pm: Paul Khum: The bible says that the word will be preached in all the inhabited places and then the end will come.
Yeah some churches do ask for a % of people's wages. This is wrong

1/05/2014 8:10:42 pm: Paul Khum: Marra your friend vana. Gives a % to his church.

1/05/2014 8:17:21 pm: Marra Lim: Yeah, I asked him why he does it. His response is "it's not my money, it's god's money". I didn't have a response

1/05/2014 8:17:59 pm: Paul Khum: Lol I asked he's brother somnang and he said the same thing to me

1/05/2014 8:18:41 pm: Paul Khum: The bible doesn't say you need to give a % to the church. It says to give what you can, but it's not mandatory

1/05/2014 8:46:33 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: What religion is that?

1/05/2014 9:59:04 pm: Paul Khum: Mormons  also known as the church of latter day saints

1/05/2014 10:02:48 pm: Terry So: I think it's more of an unwritten rule. It's pretty much an exchange of services through donations which is tax free.

1/05/2014 10:18:33 pm: Paul Khum: I'm not sure what you mean about the exchange of services?

1/05/2014 10:22:11 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Is there a movie or something
' the book of Mormons'

1/05/2014 10:23:36 pm: Paul Khum: Nah haven't seen a movie about it

1/05/2014 10:24:04 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Wonder where I've heard of it

1/05/2014 10:26:34 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Hear bout that nba clippers manager or something racist against blacks

1/05/2014 10:36:22 pm: Paul Khum: The owner of the clippers actually, yeah full racist phone call with his girl friend / mistress. Who actually looks black Lol

1/05/2014 10:36:53 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Yeh she's half Mexican / black

1/05/2014 10:37:07 pm: Paul Khum: The fucked up part is the phone calls was between him and the girl friend and she recorded it the bitch!

1/05/2014 10:38:21 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Yeh that's bad...
But for me it that this day and age ppl are still so racist.
I mean we all kno there's ppl out there like this... Just hear it from their mouth is sickenig

1/05/2014 10:39:46 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Anna mention .. On they radio they had ppl from east bitching bout westies and wests hating on east syd ppl..

Then this one girl calls up.
'Im not racist or anything but I like my area cos there's only aussies here'

1/05/2014 10:58:02 pm: Khemarint Son: Yeah I agree Paul the convo was between him and his bitchy

1/05/2014 10:58:39 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: She's obviously with him for the $$

2/05/2014 12:47:40 pm: Khemarint Son: Not to popular nowadays

2/05/2014 12:48:57 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: I don't agree with the ridiculous $180 price tag

2/05/2014 1:13:14 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Marra

2/05/2014 4:36:29 pm: Paul Khum: Shit really? Less than $100? Blardy cost me $180 from hype. That was 4 years ago too

2/05/2014 4:37:22 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Depends.. They don't have all styles

2/05/2014 4:37:37 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: U can get them for $100 here on sale too

2/05/2014 4:42:42 pm: Paul Khum: Hmm I guess it depends which style your after then. It's abit like converse / Chuck tailors. Some styles stay the same where the popular ones stay the same price

2/05/2014 4:44:20 pm: Paul Khum: You know which style your after pon?

2/05/2014 4:49:08 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: <image omitted>

7/05/2014 4:24:58 pm: Khemarint Son: U guys want to try hogs breath?

7/05/2014 4:25:13 pm: Khemarint Son: There's a voucher up atm 90$ for 200$ value

7/05/2014 4:31:24 pm: Paul Khum: I actually tried hogs breath (at Liverpool) when they were there. I was pretty disappointed to be honest

7/05/2014 4:31:49 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Wat didn't u like

7/05/2014 4:32:18 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: The meat is different to wat u would normally find

7/05/2014 4:34:08 pm: Khemarint Son: Most my friends have pretty much slammed the place

7/05/2014 4:34:35 pm: Khemarint Son: Also on the reviews on the voucher a lot of people said that it still wouldn't be worth it

7/05/2014 4:34:47 pm: Khemarint Son: Just brought it up since pon said he enjoyed it

7/05/2014 5:12:57 pm: Paul Khum: I didn't like anything about it. I didn't like the steak. And the chips (curly fries) wasn't that good either. Actually they weren't even curly fries

7/05/2014 5:13:43 pm: Paul Khum: I thought the meat was normal / mediocre

7/05/2014 5:14:02 pm: Paul Khum: I thought canley Heights bistro was better

7/05/2014 5:15:26 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Fair enough.

7/05/2014 5:19:10 pm: Paul Khum: I may have had a bad experience. Like a shit cook on that day.
One of Jens friends said he liked hogs breath. He was comparing it to milano at lansvale

7/05/2014 5:21:21 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: I've had it 3 times.
Very first time I didn't like it.

Tried it again the nx 2 times n and I thought it was alrite

7/05/2014 5:22:04 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: I think the first time is..the meat is totally different I what ur used to..

7/05/2014 5:22:29 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: But yeh. Thought I'd suggest it to try something new

7/05/2014 5:30:56 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Been looking at photos from Burma.
The country looks pretty nice in terms of temples / culture

7/05/2014 5:32:08 pm: Khemarint Son: Who wants to go Al laseel?

7/05/2014 5:32:10 pm: Khemarint Son: Turkish food

7/05/2014 5:32:16 pm: Khemarint Son: Pretty cheap hectic feed

7/05/2014 5:32:28 pm: Paul Khum: Where's this at?

7/05/2014 5:49:51 pm: Khemarint Son: I think the closest to us is green acre

7/05/2014 5:49:58 pm: Khemarint Son: Is that near banks

7/05/2014 6:21:21 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: I'm good with anything

7/05/2014 6:34:59 pm: Terry So: I remember hogs breath being disappointing.

7/05/2014 6:35:27 pm: Terry So: Tried it a second time , it wasn't bad. But I don't like hit and miss places

7/05/2014 6:35:41 pm: Terry So: They have a standard. They should live up to it.

7/05/2014 6:48:57 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah its pretty hard in the food industry, I'd day its probably one of hardest to work in.

7/05/2014 6:52:06 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: There's a trend here for the first time being bad

7/05/2014 6:54:13 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah I was turned off the first time. Never been

7/05/2014 7:26:36 pm: Paul Khum: Never been back after that.....

8/05/2014 7:41:00 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Will it be difficult for u guys to get into the city, n find parking?

8/05/2014 9:07:58 am: Paul Khum: It would be a bit for marra.

8/05/2014 9:08:17 am: Paul Khum: Nah I told jen that tthe cousins wanted to have a catch up dinner

8/05/2014 9:08:34 am: Paul Khum: And she just said "oh okay I'm going too"

8/05/2014 9:09:58 am: Ponnorraks Ou: I word it as "I'm catching up with my cousins next week"

If we planned to invite partners.. I'll add "do u wanna come?"

8/05/2014 9:13:10 am: Paul Khum: Nah I didn't say 'do you wanna come' Lol

8/05/2014 9:13:18 am: Paul Khum: She kinda invited to herself

8/05/2014 9:14:18 am: Ponnorraks Ou: U should try that on her nx time she goes out with her friends.

"Alrite let me get dressed, I'm going with u"

8/05/2014 9:14:35 am: Terry So: What was the next line of dialog after "oh okay, I'm coming too"?

8/05/2014 9:14:51 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Paul said "ok"

8/05/2014 9:16:21 am: Paul Khum: Lol nah I was like 'err it might just be the cousins.....'

8/05/2014 9:16:57 am: Khemarint Son: U need to be more assertive

8/05/2014 9:17:02 am: Khemarint Son: Show your dominance

8/05/2014 9:17:13 am: Khemarint Son: Atm your acting like a beta?!

8/05/2014 9:19:46 am: Paul Khum: I'm trying to be diplomatic at the same time

8/05/2014 9:19:57 am: Paul Khum: Like hey I got nothing to hide......

8/05/2014 9:21:14 am: Khemarint Son: Haha good point

8/05/2014 9:21:57 am: Paul Khum: She thinks I'm using a cousins catch up as a smoke screen to see my mistress

8/05/2014 9:23:26 am: Paul Khum: Like I can't be too assertive and say "Fuck no its boys only" Lol wish I could

8/05/2014 9:24:45 am: Khemarint Son: Hahaha

8/05/2014 9:24:55 am: Khemarint Son: U might as well have  a mistress

8/05/2014 9:28:46 am: Terry So: Wow, she can't trust you to hang out with your cousins?

8/05/2014 9:29:23 am: Ponnorraks Ou: U being serious about her thinking u have a mistress or is that a jk?

8/05/2014 9:32:30 am: Khemarint Son: Terry this is what it's like having a missus

8/05/2014 9:43:04 am: Paul Khum: Like I do have a few gfs (purely friend zone) and she doesn't like it at all

8/05/2014 9:43:38 am: Paul Khum: Like I have 2 Viet girlfriends who I've known before meeting jen. And she doesn't like me catching up with them

8/05/2014 9:44:16 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Summer time. "Hun, I'm just going pons house"
"I'll come with u"

8/05/2014 9:44:27 am: Paul Khum: Man she went through my Facebook account and read my messages, goes through my phone here and there

8/05/2014 9:44:43 am: Paul Khum: Lol exactly that's how it is pon.

8/05/2014 9:45:30 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Surprised u were allowed to gym on ur own last night

8/05/2014 9:48:25 am: Paul Khum: I don't think she even wanted me to go to the gym. There's been a few times that Jens been like "I don't feel like going gym today" and I'm like 'okay I'm still going......'
Then she goes "okay I'm going to go too"

8/05/2014 9:50:19 am: Paul Khum: Man I really don't know guys..... She didn't like me meeting up with a uni friend (girl) for lunch in the city... She's like "you shouldn't be meeting up with girls with me not there"
Yet she meets up with guys that she's worked with for lunch? Like Wtf! Double standards

8/05/2014 10:21:49 am: Terry So: Have you given her a reason to doubt you? Have you lied in the past to make her feel insecure? Or was she like this since the start, that is, ten years ago?

8/05/2014 10:37:50 am: Paul Khum: No to my recollection I don't believe I have ever done anything to make her dout me in this way.
Hmm she's never trusted me with anyone of the opposite sex.

8/05/2014 10:38:46 am: Paul Khum: Then slowly I feel she's become more insecure over the years

8/05/2014 10:39:56 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Yeh I actually remember u saying that she's insecure like 10 years ago when we were cruising in the 86 Honda

8/05/2014 10:41:05 am: Paul Khum: yeah the fucked up thing is she doesn't like me having friends who are female. But she's able to meet up with who  she wants. And she would hide it from me

8/05/2014 10:41:35 am: Paul Khum: Guys I'm not stupid, sometimes she meets up with guys she use to work and she would cover it up by saying "oh we have a team lunch"

8/05/2014 10:41:45 am: Khemarint Son: Haha

8/05/2014 10:41:49 am: Khemarint Son: U let it happen

8/05/2014 10:43:25 am: Khemarint Son: U gotta put ur foot down

8/05/2014 10:43:28 am: Paul Khum: Lol how but? Like what I'm supposed to do? Rule her with a iron fist?

8/05/2014 10:43:31 am: Khemarint Son: If she is lying about it

8/05/2014 10:44:35 am: Paul Khum: Well I only found out when I went through her phone, during my paranoid times. And quite frankly I'm over going through her phone. Not my style never has been

8/05/2014 10:49:30 am: Paul Khum: See I can't say she was lying, but she didn't even tell me about it

8/05/2014 10:49:51 am: Khemarint Son: Haha yes u had a dark period

8/05/2014 10:50:24 am: Terry So: You can only suspect something if it's come across your mind before.

8/05/2014 10:50:25 am: Paul Khum: Like if I'm having lunch with anyone she would know. Cause I'd tell her. I'd be like "babe no need to pack lunch I'm having lunch with dolly tomorrow"

8/05/2014 10:50:38 am: Paul Khum: Lol man I was the dark knight, I'll admit that.

8/05/2014 10:51:39 am: Ponnorraks Ou: I've read ppl are sometimes insecure of certain things because they are guilty of doing the same thing

8/05/2014 10:51:57 am: Paul Khum: Yes pon! I thought the same

8/05/2014 10:52:30 am: Paul Khum: Like I'm clean guys! I have nothing to hide.
Okay I smoke this and that, but hey she knows about it. I don't like hiding things

8/05/2014 11:31:15 am: Paul Khum: Anyway with this dinner next week.... Where should we eat?

8/05/2014 11:31:38 am: Paul Khum: I'm up for any suggestions you guys have.

12/05/2014 11:44:18 am: Khemarint Son: So what are we gonna do

12/05/2014 11:44:24 am: Khemarint Son: Coz terry finishes to late

12/05/2014 11:44:43 am: Khemarint Son: By the time he get there it will be 830

12/05/2014 11:47:33 am: Marra Lim: I can finish at 7, meet anywhere at 7:30ish

12/05/2014 11:47:52 am: Marra Lim: I really don't care where we meet

12/05/2014 11:52:54 am: Khemarint Son: Terrt finishes 730 in the city

12/05/2014 11:53:11 am: Khemarint Son: It would be hard getting  parking for 4 cars

12/05/2014 11:53:21 am: Khemarint Son: Anywhere up here

12/05/2014 11:56:17 am: Khemarint Son: 830 dinner (prob what time terry gets to green acre) is pretty late but up to u guys

12/05/2014 12:08:21 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Let's just book for 830
Maybe we can all meet up before hand for drinks or something else

12/05/2014 12:08:45 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: I'll just have to eat a bit b4 I leave work
Else I'll starve

12/05/2014 12:08:56 pm: Khemarint Son: Ya I'll prob do the same

12/05/2014 3:39:50 pm: Paul Khum: Or should we meet somewhere that's closer to terry?

12/05/2014 3:41:32 pm: Paul Khum: Greenarce might be abit optimistic

12/05/2014 3:51:28 pm: Khemarint Son: Surry?

12/05/2014 3:51:34 pm: Khemarint Son: Lots of places there

12/05/2014 3:51:39 pm: Khemarint Son: Even an Al laseel

12/05/2014 3:51:55 pm: Khemarint Son: Or newtown

12/05/2014 5:09:52 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: U guys with cars decide
I kno I wouldn't wanna be trying to find car park in certain areas after 730..8pm

12/05/2014 5:50:55 pm: Marra Lim: Friday night is a bitch everywhere. I really don't mind. We all live in the same area. How about green pepper? By the time Terry gets in the area, Food will be ready, and everyone else snack prior so you don't starve? ( just a suggestion)

12/05/2014 5:54:37 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Yeh closer to home sounds good.

12/05/2014 9:05:04 pm: Khemarint Son: Ya ok good idea marra

12/05/2014 9:05:34 pm: Khemarint Son: We can hang out at the pub first

12/05/2014 9:18:21 pm: Marra Lim: Either way. Saturday morning is also a suggestion at the garden centre if we can all wake up. But conversing at night time is a little easier than early morning. So we will work with Friday night ATM.

13/05/2014 12:00:33 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah I'm keen on closer to home too. We can do this Turkish food when time isn't so much of a factor for everyone

13/05/2014 3:02:44 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Cool
Meet at ffield 730ish?
From memory u can't book Friday nights. So just walk in for a table

13/05/2014 3:18:16 pm: Terry So: I guess when we get a table(8:30pm), I'll arrive.

13/05/2014 3:35:07 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Terry was expected to arrive at green acre at 830.

Still good for ffield at 830?

13/05/2014 3:46:58 pm: Khemarint Son: Ya Fairfield 830 is reasonable

13/05/2014 3:47:14 pm: Khemarint Son: Green pepper is an option

13/05/2014 3:47:23 pm: Khemarint Son: James bistro is owned by the same guys

13/05/2014 3:47:31 pm: Khemarint Son: Food look good from Fb

13/05/2014 4:07:35 pm: Terry So: James bistro? Where's that?

13/05/2014 4:08:27 pm: Paul Khum: It's on smart street

13/05/2014 4:08:32 pm: Marra Lim: James bistro is pretty good. I've tried it.

13/05/2014 4:08:54 pm: Paul Khum: I've never tried it....

13/05/2014 4:09:03 pm: Marra Lim: It's got a similar layout to Grilled( burger place)

13/05/2014 4:14:13 pm: Paul Khum: James bistro looks small

13/05/2014 4:14:24 pm: Marra Lim: It is small.

13/05/2014 4:32:26 pm: Terry So: Does anyone know anywhere to buy laptops?

13/05/2014 4:37:56 pm: Khemarint Son: What brand u want

13/05/2014 4:56:44 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Does James own a bistro?

13/05/2014 5:03:42 pm: Paul Khum: Hahah Nah it's a bistro that's called "James bistro"  who is the same owner as green pepper corn

13/05/2014 5:04:07 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Ooh

13/05/2014 5:14:53 pm: Marra Lim: I've been told they're brothers, I don't remember the prices. If you haven't tried it, then it's worth giving it a go.

13/05/2014 5:14:55 pm: Khemarint Son: Ya that's the word on the street

13/05/2014 5:15:12 pm: Khemarint Son: FYI there's a holy basil in city now

13/05/2014 5:15:17 pm: Marra Lim: Green pepper is also opening at civic hotel in the

13/05/2014 5:15:35 pm: Marra Lim: Hahaha

13/05/2014 5:16:22 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Yeh that's wat i meant

13/05/2014 5:16:35 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: But damn...

13/05/2014 5:25:54 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Koreans normally only date their own tho?

13/05/2014 5:26:38 pm: Marra Lim: If your a pure cambo, born in cambo. It might be a challenge getting your own kind. Unless your a really good motor bike rider.

13/05/2014 5:26:44 pm: Marra Lim: JK

13/05/2014 5:39:34 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Anyone keen?

13/05/2014 5:40:06 pm: Marra Lim: That's when you get involved and create a system to duplicate what your mum knows.

13/05/2014 5:40:47 pm: Marra Lim: Remember, most people prefer their own mums cooking, till they move out and discover their partner can also cook to.

13/05/2014 5:40:58 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: I rekn... If we get all our parents recipes... It'll be a killer restaurants

13/05/2014 5:41:12 pm: Marra Lim: I've got 5 weeks experience

13/05/2014 5:41:38 pm: Marra Lim: But, you just got to westernise it

13/05/2014 5:41:42 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: I've had mad food from khems mum.
Grandma also cooked Somethin nice for Emily's I've never tried b4

13/05/2014 5:42:04 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Even Emily's mums cooking

13/05/2014 5:42:54 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Just make the restaurant fancy looking.
And serve on giant square plates

13/05/2014 5:49:32 pm: Marra Lim: We have pretty good unique desserts to

13/05/2014 5:58:21 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah we have a few good ones.....

13/05/2014 6:10:43 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: I'm really keen on a unique Cambo restaurant

13/05/2014 6:12:07 pm: Marra Lim: It's achievable, a lot of work, but achievable

13/05/2014 6:12:56 pm: Marra Lim: Get yourself a business plan, then go crazy..

13/05/2014 6:16:12 pm: Marra Lim: I think there is a market for it as well in the area.

13/05/2014 6:16:46 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Can't do It on my own

13/05/2014 6:16:53 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: I can't cook for shit either

13/05/2014 6:16:54 pm: Marra Lim: There is probably a couple of cambo guys in Bonnyrigg planning one at the moment

13/05/2014 6:19:48 pm: Marra Lim: Cuzz, you got a good network of people around you to give you good advice.

13/05/2014 6:20:22 pm: Terry So: Holy Basil's owner and green peppercorn's owner. Same family but they had a dispute. So the brother went out and made green peppercorn. In shark hotel, holy basil doesn't pay rent cause it attracts customers during the non peak periods for the bar. Shark hotel gain profits just by having them there.

13/05/2014 6:20:39 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Let us be the Cambo cousins that can do it

13/05/2014 6:21:08 pm: Marra Lim: You might want to offer your labour to a restaurant e.g, green pepper/ holy basil and act as a mole. Aka learning school, so you can duplicate and compete with a different product

13/05/2014 6:21:42 pm: Paul Khum: Lol marra corporate espionage

13/05/2014 6:24:05 pm: Marra Lim: Cuzz the idea sounds great, but you might have issues dividing the profits. It's best you go solo. Your labour, your $$$ is at stake , you reap 100% profits and everyone else is hired on an hourly basis.

13/05/2014 6:24:08 pm: Paul Khum: Why do you think we worked at mosman chef? It was to steal your meat pie recipe!

13/05/2014 6:24:52 pm: Khemarint Son: Fuk them. Pies were hectic

13/05/2014 6:25:23 pm: Paul Khum: They were awesome

13/05/2014 6:25:49 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Chunky beaf pie!

13/05/2014 6:25:53 pm: Marra Lim: I'm sure everyone in the chat will be more than happy to give you advice/ put their 2 cents worth. Partnerships get complicated.

13/05/2014 6:26:17 pm: Marra Lim: Hahaha. Go crazy.

13/05/2014 6:26:22 pm: Paul Khum: There's pros and cons go both but. 😃

13/05/2014 6:26:52 pm: Paul Khum: Partnership we could gain larger starting capital. And more diverse range of experience

13/05/2014 6:26:59 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Can't do it wih Anna..

She'll want viet food in there

13/05/2014 6:28:12 pm: Marra Lim: Apparently fitness studio is a 3 way partnership. I'm not sure how that is working out. But I guess it can work

13/05/2014 6:30:21 pm: Khemarint Son: They owned the restaurant too

13/05/2014 6:30:27 pm: Khemarint Son: It's my friends brothers

13/05/2014 6:31:01 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Wats the reason for changing names

13/05/2014 6:31:15 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Good day seafood restuarant

13/05/2014 6:31:25 pm: Khemarint Son: I think they sold it

13/05/2014 6:33:23 pm: Paul Khum: Fitness studio looks quite now

13/05/2014 6:34:44 pm: Marra Lim: I've never been, people are  chasing the new fad of cross fit. One at warwick farm does pretty well.

13/05/2014 6:35:28 pm: Marra Lim: I think there is one in burwood to. It's just different fit out. E.g ropes, and weights you can drop

13/05/2014 6:36:49 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Partings to crazy for fitness studio

13/05/2014 6:36:51 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Parking

13/05/2014 6:37:16 pm: Khemarint Son: I've got a lot of friends that do it

13/05/2014 6:37:23 pm: Khemarint Son: Boisans been doing it for a while

13/05/2014 6:39:04 pm: Khemarint Son: The weights u can drop are heaps good

13/05/2014 6:39:08 pm: Khemarint Son: Wish I could. Afford. Em

13/05/2014 9:09:46 pm: Paul Khum: Anyone here check out the federal budget?

13/05/2014 9:10:30 pm: Marra Lim: Yeah, I was listen to it from 7:30 on 2gb, then a little when I got home. Nothing for me

13/05/2014 9:10:48 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: What's happening with it

13/05/2014 9:11:11 pm: Marra Lim: There's a lot to take in. Information overload.

13/05/2014 9:13:48 pm: Paul Khum: It's going to cost everyone $7 to see the doctor now

13/05/2014 9:14:46 pm: Marra Lim: That's kinda messed as we pay the Medicare levy.

13/05/2014 9:15:24 pm: Marra Lim: But then again, I don't see doctors that much so I don't care.

13/05/2014 9:17:07 pm: Marra Lim: I'm not surprise that came through, as people won't respect the system, unless money exchanges hand. And to prevent it getting abused

13/05/2014 9:17:26 pm: Paul Khum: So bad news boys, doctors certificate just went up. Btw if anyone needs let me know 😉

13/05/2014 9:17:55 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah true marra but we do pay a medical care levy already

13/05/2014 9:18:06 pm: Marra Lim: Anyone earning over 180k gonna pay an extra 2% , and it gets higher as you earn more. Something like that. But that's only for 3 years.

13/05/2014 9:20:11 pm: Paul Khum: Will the $7 co payment also go after 3 years?

13/05/2014 9:20:51 pm: Marra Lim: Not 100% sure

13/05/2014 9:21:48 pm: Paul Khum: You guys are all healthy young men, so you may not see the doctor regularly. I however do see the doctor quite a bit during the year for my health. I'm already paying $15 for 15mins to see the doctor

13/05/2014 9:22:02 pm: Khemarint Son: I don't mind the 7$ fee tbh

13/05/2014 9:22:12 pm: Khemarint Son: Not gonna impact us at all

13/05/2014 9:22:18 pm: Paul Khum: But let's think of the older generation which may have to see the doctor more frequently

13/05/2014 9:22:24 pm: Khemarint Son: It's the pensioners whicj get slapped

13/05/2014 9:22:28 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: I was already paying to $10..$15 to see a doctor

13/05/2014 9:22:37 pm: Khemarint Son: Lol ur ducked pon!

13/05/2014 9:22:43 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: But I'm at the doctors like once every 2 years

13/05/2014 9:22:43 pm: Khemarint Son: Ur Asian man

13/05/2014 9:22:48 pm: Khemarint Son: Need to see bulk billed doc

13/05/2014 9:23:16 pm: Paul Khum: Ye same! I have two gp. One bulk bill the other doesn't

13/05/2014 9:23:21 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Haha yeh
It's Terry's doc from wetherill

13/05/2014 9:23:28 pm: Paul Khum: Yes! Dr lai!

13/05/2014 9:23:32 pm: Paul Khum: He's Fucken  good man

13/05/2014 9:24:28 pm: Paul Khum: Dr who currently don't bulk bill can, because they are in high demand

13/05/2014 9:26:00 pm: Paul Khum: Let's think about our parents who might need to see the doctor more frequently. I would hate for them to not see the doctor because of the $7

13/05/2014 9:28:51 pm: Khemarint Son: True that

13/05/2014 9:34:10 pm: Marra Lim: The system use to work well because everyone pays the Medicare levy, and less people were sick. Hence the system was sustainable. Now there have been an influx of people entering the country, a growing population of retirees, and people take the piss out of the system. So the governments position is allow it to run at a loss, or tax something/ someone else as a source of revenue to fund Medicare.

13/05/2014 9:35:03 pm: Paul Khum: Correct usher, the group to blame (mainly) are the baby boomers

13/05/2014 9:36:19 pm: Marra Lim: Agreed, governments also making the retirement age 70 now. I think it was previously 60 or 65

13/05/2014 9:37:32 pm: Paul Khum: It was 65, went up to 67 and now it's 70.

13/05/2014 9:44:24 pm: Paul Khum: Channel 24 boys!

13/05/2014 9:46:23 pm: Paul Khum: Okay the ABC has a competition going.
Give your summary of budget in 3 words....

13/05/2014 10:02:48 pm: Paul Khum: Man from 2016 universities will set their own fees.

13/05/2014 10:07:04 pm: Paul Khum: Man you know what, a carbon tax doesn't sound so bad now Lol

13/05/2014 10:37:26 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: all coz of ur mate tony.

13/05/2014 10:53:17 pm: Paul Khum: Badly, I'll give him a call tomorrow morning. Let him know what I think about it.

14/05/2014 2:31:15 am: Terry So: About going to the doctors, I was talking to my friend who's a gp, she tells me people go to her cause to chat to her cause she's lonely. And you know who pays her to have a conversation? Our tax dollars! That's $50 per 15 minutes. Our tax dollars which people keep complaining are too high. Also, just getting a doctor's certificate. People come in, 3 minute appointment, just to get a piece of paper to excuse them from work. Just a small fee of $7 will force people not to ruin the system.

14/05/2014 6:58:55 am: Ponnorraks Ou: .. So ur GP friend is wasting our tax dollar money coz she's lonely?

14/05/2014 7:07:39 am: Ponnorraks Ou: There's always a few sides, problems to the story.
There's always going to be someone ruining the system. In your example there's the Lonely GP, and the  patients who go in just for a doc cert, which I'm sure we all done in the past.
The other side are ppl who are genuinely sick.. For those who are unfortunate, older ppl, or big family's that may not be able to afford that small $7 each time they need to see a doctor. I think everyone should have access to see a doctor.

14/05/2014 7:24:25 am: Khemarint Son: No

14/05/2014 7:24:40 am: Khemarint Son: He Saod people go to the docs coz there lonely/bored

14/05/2014 7:25:31 am: Khemarint Son: Not the doc

14/05/2014 7:26:09 am: Khemarint Son: I think

14/05/2014 7:26:11 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Hmm. Fair enough.
It's not how I read it

14/05/2014 7:26:19 am: Khemarint Son: Actually I re read

14/05/2014 7:26:21 am: Khemarint Son: It

14/05/2014 7:26:30 am: Khemarint Son: Terry has a bad way with words

14/05/2014 7:26:52 am: Khemarint Son: Anyway u make a good point

14/05/2014 7:27:21 am: Khemarint Son: It's mostly going to affect old people

14/05/2014 7:28:53 am: Khemarint Son: Wonder what the stats are like

14/05/2014 7:29:04 am: Khemarint Son: Like what is the net benefit of this scheme

14/05/2014 7:45:58 am: Khemarint Son: For me I still like this idea as healthcare cost a lot money more so as our society. Ages

14/05/2014 7:47:14 am: Khemarint Son: If u looks at. Japan now they are having big issues because their people are aging more than the population growth to sustain it (less young people paying tax to support the old people who are healthy so they live longer)

14/05/2014 7:47:47 am: Khemarint Son: Australia u got kidney problems?  Gov will pay

14/05/2014 7:47:54 am: Khemarint Son: Eye problems?  Gov pays

14/05/2014 7:48:35 am: Khemarint Son: Generally healthcare is very accessible for all -  the money needs to come from somewhere

14/05/2014 7:49:24 am: Khemarint Son: I'd rather this system than one you would have only the richer or more well or have access ie USA

14/05/2014 7:53:41 am: Marra Lim: That's a good point, I like the $7 fee also. I though they were gonna come up with a $5 fee. How they came up with $7 I don't know.

As long as those who are abusing the system are being flushed out, and the genuine people who really need it are getting the required services. I think it can only be a good thing to keep it sustainable

14/05/2014 7:55:03 am: Marra Lim: As there have been arguments raise that one day Medicare will no longer exists. I hope it stays around for ever as we will all be old some day.

14/05/2014 7:57:27 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Good points

14/05/2014 7:58:24 am: Khemarint Son: Man I was shocked to find out how much the red puffer cost (for asthma)

14/05/2014 7:58:36 am: Khemarint Son: The gov forks out about 50$

14/05/2014 7:58:50 am: Khemarint Son: For one of them for us

14/05/2014 9:35:05 am: Paul Khum: So terry's doctor friend sees someone for 3 minutes, but still charges the government for a full fee?

14/05/2014 11:23:48 am: Paul Khum: And again, terry's friend sees someone's for 3 minutes and still charges the Australian government for a normal consultation? Who's doing the wrong thing here?

14/05/2014 12:27:57 pm: Terry So: Lol Paul, I mean patients get lonely so they come and talk to her.

14/05/2014 12:28:32 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah I understand that part. But she still charges the government as normal right? 😉

14/05/2014 12:28:50 pm: Terry So: Every consultation is a minimum of ten minutes I think. Long consultation is fifteen. My bad.

14/05/2014 12:29:24 pm: Terry So: You know a concreters charges you for 4 hours of service each time?

14/05/2014 12:29:27 pm: Paul Khum: I thought it was 15mins for a short and 30mins for long. This is what I pay at Dr lai (terry old house)

14/05/2014 12:29:44 pm: Terry So: They go in for 30 minutes, 4 hours pay.

14/05/2014 12:29:54 pm: Terry So: Oh, so it is 15 and 30.

14/05/2014 12:30:30 pm: Terry So: Lawyers charge their clients for every 12 minutes.

14/05/2014 12:30:49 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah what about a prostitute? They charge minimum 30mins and your only in there for 5 minutes

14/05/2014 12:31:13 pm: Terry So: Same point.

14/05/2014 12:31:57 pm: Terry So: So why are you asking why does she still charge the govt for 15 minutes?

14/05/2014 12:32:42 pm: Paul Khum: Cause we're all having to pay for those services from our taxes

14/05/2014 12:32:57 pm: Paul Khum: To cover other people who are abusing the system

14/05/2014 12:33:34 pm: Terry So: That's just how the rate of pay goes. She's not abusing it.

14/05/2014 12:34:18 pm: Paul Khum: If the doctor only charged the government the true cost of their services it would eliminate the argument that people go in there cause they're lonely. May be we need to change the way doctors are reimbursed for their time?

14/05/2014 12:34:25 pm: Terry So: People are abusing the system cause it doesn't directly come out of their wallets. It comes out of this thing everyone complains about, tax.

14/05/2014 12:35:51 pm: Paul Khum: We all pay for Medicare levy but, whether we use the doctors or not.

14/05/2014 12:36:23 pm: Paul Khum: Don't you think your friend should charge less if she only saw someone for 3 minutes?

14/05/2014 12:36:40 pm: Terry So: Nay

14/05/2014 12:36:47 pm: Paul Khum: Why does she need to charge a full consultation if she only saw someone for 5mibs?

14/05/2014 12:36:47 pm: Terry So: She booked out 15 ninutes

14/05/2014 12:36:51 pm: Terry So: In her schedule

14/05/2014 12:36:59 pm: Terry So: And only gets paid 3 minutes?

14/05/2014 12:37:25 pm: Paul Khum: Her schedule is now free for the next 10mins now

14/05/2014 12:37:35 pm: Terry So: How does she know whether she's going to get a lousy patient asking for a piece of paper

14/05/2014 12:38:01 pm: Paul Khum: She doesn't

14/05/2014 12:38:12 pm: Terry So: To do what? Hope a patient comes running through the door to open up time?

14/05/2014 12:39:30 pm: Paul Khum: Well were saying she's only worked for 3mins but she's gonna get paid a full session

14/05/2014 12:39:49 pm: Terry So: She's not paid by the minute.

14/05/2014 12:40:01 pm: Terry So: She's paid by every 15 minutes

14/05/2014 12:40:35 pm: Khemarint Son: Paul I agree with terry here

14/05/2014 12:40:46 pm: Khemarint Son: The docs need to allow time to patients to come in

14/05/2014 12:40:58 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Are doctors only paid when they see a patient ?
do they have a salary

14/05/2014 12:40:59 pm: Khemarint Son: Have u ever been to an overbooked doctor?

14/05/2014 12:41:03 pm: Paul Khum: Don't you think the way doctors are paid should be looked at?

14/05/2014 12:41:20 pm: Khemarint Son: In cabra u can wait hours even when you have a booking!

14/05/2014 12:41:33 pm: Khemarint Son: No because how do they know there gonna only be 3minz?

14/05/2014 12:41:41 pm: Khemarint Son: U can't book an extra patient in that time

14/05/2014 12:41:53 pm: Khemarint Son: This is just an exMple btw

14/05/2014 12:42:01 pm: Khemarint Son: It's not just doctors
This is normal for every industry

14/05/2014 12:43:04 pm: Terry So: Your brothel isn't going to charge you 5 minutes of service just. They're going to charge you the 30 minutes.

14/05/2014 12:43:16 pm: Terry So: Why should doctors do the same?

14/05/2014 12:43:40 pm: Khemarint Son: In cabra no joke I waited 2 hours

14/05/2014 12:43:44 pm: Khemarint Son: After my booking time

14/05/2014 12:43:51 pm: Khemarint Son: Lol fkn Asians

14/05/2014 12:43:52 pm: Terry So: The way Asians work

14/05/2014 12:44:00 pm: Paul Khum: It's too easy to just say "oh that's the way it is, she's not abusing it" I know what you mean. But we're all paying tax plus Medicare levy already.
Plus your gp is the first point of contact for everything. If you need to see a specialist you need to see a go first for a referral, it's all win for the doctors

14/05/2014 12:44:03 pm: Terry So: They see someone run in, take squeeze you in

14/05/2014 12:44:37 pm: Paul Khum: You might  just be in there for 10mins. "Dr I need to see a specialist......"  'okay let me write you a letter....'

14/05/2014 12:44:58 pm: Terry So: They usually assess you before they do that

14/05/2014 12:45:07 pm: Khemarint Son: I see what ur saying

14/05/2014 12:45:17 pm: Khemarint Son: Could there be a better way to bill?

14/05/2014 12:45:17 pm: Paul Khum: $7 isn't much, but it adds up if your your seeing the doctor heaps every year

14/05/2014 12:45:47 pm: Terry So: $7 is so small. I'd cry if I had to pay $50.

14/05/2014 12:46:08 pm: Paul Khum: Lol I'm paying $15 to $30 already.

14/05/2014 12:46:14 pm: Terry So: I do too

14/05/2014 12:46:19 pm: Terry So: I see dr Lai.

14/05/2014 12:46:22 pm: Khemarint Son: Man most docs

14/05/2014 12:46:25 pm: Khemarint Son: Outside of our area

14/05/2014 12:46:30 pm: Khemarint Son: Charge a killing

14/05/2014 12:46:34 pm: Khemarint Son: 50$

14/05/2014 12:46:39 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah Dr lai is the best gp in our area (I say)

14/05/2014 12:46:39 pm: Terry So: Really?

14/05/2014 12:46:44 pm: Khemarint Son: No use chucking a sickie for that price

14/05/2014 12:46:51 pm: Paul Khum: Yep north Sydney it's like $60

14/05/2014 12:46:54 pm: Khemarint Son: Well that's my mates doc

14/05/2014 12:47:42 pm: Terry So: Did you know, you can go to the pharmacist and get a doctor's cert?

14/05/2014 12:47:50 pm: Khemarint Son: I heard that too

14/05/2014 12:47:54 pm: Khemarint Son: Is this legit

14/05/2014 12:47:56 pm: Terry So: Yeah

14/05/2014 12:48:07 pm: Terry So: But don't use it for exams

14/05/2014 12:48:14 pm: Terry So: Or something really important

14/05/2014 12:48:40 pm: Paul Khum: Lol hsc exam.

14/05/2014 12:48:41 pm: Terry So: My friend got called up cause she wrote a doc cert for her friend.

14/05/2014 12:49:24 pm: Khemarint Son: Hahaha

14/05/2014 12:49:28 pm: Khemarint Son: Is she a doc?

14/05/2014 12:49:28 pm: Terry So: I'm not sure if they have the med number. But they do call up just to make sure you're not pulling shit.

14/05/2014 12:49:30 pm: Terry So: Yeah

14/05/2014 12:49:49 pm: Paul Khum: Yes some work places actually call the doctor to see if you went.
"I have a cert for khem son...... " 'khem Son? I havnt seen him for 15 years.....'

14/05/2014 12:50:18 pm: Khemarint Son: Hahaha

14/05/2014 12:52:03 pm: Terry So: But yeah Paul, just because it's coming from our tax, I don't think their industry should be run in any other way. Every industry does it. Dentist do it too. My friend just waives that off for me.

14/05/2014 12:52:37 pm: Terry So: Optometrists do it as well. They get their money from Medicare.

14/05/2014 12:53:19 pm: Paul Khum: Oh yeah they're another bad one. Even though you get eye care for $80. Most will claim back $150 (the maximum)

14/05/2014 12:53:36 pm: Terry So: That's the optom

14/05/2014 12:53:41 pm: Terry So: Not the patient

14/05/2014 12:59:00 pm: Paul Khum: Ye that's right. Optomotrist would claim the whole benefit

14/05/2014 12:59:39 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: I would do the same if I were a doctor.. Opt..

14/05/2014 1:09:30 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah unfortunately most people would.... Probably a reason why the health bills are so high

14/05/2014 1:10:17 pm: Terry So: They catch you out on those things. Fine you a crap load.

14/05/2014 1:10:40 pm: Terry So: Especially the private health ones.

14/05/2014 1:11:13 pm: Terry So: I don't know how regularly they do it but they do checkups.

14/05/2014 1:11:30 pm: Terry So: Not sure if you lose your licence to practice.

14/05/2014 4:00:51 pm: Paul Khum: So anyone who was born after 1965 will have to work until they're 70. What year was Joe hockey born? 1965......lol

14/05/2014 4:18:35 pm: Khemarint Son: I Dont mind the change

14/05/2014 4:18:44 pm: Khemarint Son: I think it will go up again by the time we retire

14/05/2014 4:19:14 pm: Paul Khum: Really? I'd like to retire asap really. Yeah it would probably go up

14/05/2014 4:19:18 pm: Khemarint Son: People living longer from the sounds of it so we are having aging population

14/05/2014 4:19:37 pm: Khemarint Son: Im thinking from a macro stand point I give it thumbs you

14/05/2014 4:19:39 pm: Khemarint Son: Up*

14/05/2014 4:19:50 pm: Khemarint Son: Nigger if I didn't have to work tomorrow I'd quit right now lol

14/05/2014 4:20:15 pm: Paul Khum: Lol it might be abit easier for us office working people. Since we do shit all 😃

14/05/2014 4:20:35 pm: Paul Khum: Blue collar people, it would be hard man

14/05/2014 4:23:01 pm: Marra Lim: It's gonna be tough for me

14/05/2014 4:23:14 pm: Marra Lim: JK, I wouldn't know

14/05/2014 4:24:49 pm: Marra Lim: It's grandpas birthday this Friday. I think.

14/05/2014 4:24:59 pm: Paul Khum: It's easy for us now cause we're still young. But come on at age 65, it would get a bit challenginh

14/05/2014 4:25:06 pm: Marra Lim: I think his still able to work. But his got life too good.

14/05/2014 4:25:21 pm: Paul Khum: Lol man I don't see him working. He's old as

14/05/2014 4:26:54 pm: Marra Lim: dam, as long as his employers don't expect him to be proactive

14/05/2014 4:27:14 pm: Marra Lim: 79 as security. I guess he can observe and report.

14/05/2014 4:27:26 pm: Khemarint Son: Hahaha

14/05/2014 4:28:17 pm: Marra Lim: The guy prob doesn't even need the money, but just doing it for human interaction.

14/05/2014 4:30:06 pm: Khemarint Son: Haha nah he told us he needs money for his kid and wife

14/05/2014 4:30:10 pm: Khemarint Son: His wife was 40

14/05/2014 4:36:15 pm: Marra Lim: Once your older, age gap means shit

14/05/2014 4:37:08 pm: Marra Lim: It's just during high school times, 1 yr is a bit of a difference

14/05/2014 4:38:17 pm: Marra Lim: If I'm old, I would prob be like Hugh Hefner if I could.

14/05/2014 4:38:25 pm: Marra Lim: Maybe not.

14/05/2014 4:38:36 pm: Marra Lim: That life style doesn't interest me .:)

14/05/2014 4:41:10 pm: Paul Khum: Men generally need a woman to look after them. Look at grandpa re married within the first year of grandma's passing.
...

14/05/2014 4:42:45 pm: Marra Lim: Good on him, I expect that from my partner to if I was to go.

14/05/2014 4:42:58 pm: Marra Lim: Regardless who it is

14/05/2014 4:42:24 pm: Paul Khum changed this group's icon

14/05/2014 5:17:23 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Anna's mums pretty superstitious.. She said a month ago that the grandma will go coz it'll be the grandpas 1 year..

14/05/2014 5:17:55 pm: Marra Lim: Sorry to hear it. How did Anna take and her fam take it? They doing ok?

14/05/2014 5:18:22 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Yeh.
I rekn they're all watching us!
"Go grandson! U did great in karting"

14/05/2014 5:18:40 pm: Paul Khum: Dam man that's scary. I believe that they're demons (fallen angles) rather than actual dead love ones

14/05/2014 5:18:40 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Yeh they're okay.
Her dad's going overseas this Friday

14/05/2014 5:19:25 pm: Marra Lim: Yeah, the though of them watching over us is comforting except when your between the sheets.

14/05/2014 5:19:29 pm: Paul Khum: But yeah I do believe in these ghost.
I reckon I saw a ghost before, it was actually pretty scary

14/05/2014 5:20:07 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Hahayeh marra.. Or watching porn

14/05/2014 5:23:10 pm: Khemarint Son: Wow fallen ages Paul

14/05/2014 5:23:13 pm: Khemarint Son: Angels*

14/05/2014 5:23:36 pm: Khemarint Son: Pretty interesting hearing things like that

14/05/2014 5:23:36 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: I remember back at Cambo school.
Cambo girl from overseas came stay/live with relos.
She said she had a dream was there was a lady talking to her telling her to pass on some message to the family. No idea who it was. She told the family and confirm who it was in family photos. It was an aunty who had passed... And she's never met her in her life

14/05/2014 5:26:01 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah theses things do happen, but the bible says that theses are actually fallen angles who trick us in believing it's our love ones

14/05/2014 5:26:15 pm: Paul Khum: So the bible does recognise the these things do happen.

14/05/2014 5:26:33 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: My dad actually had some bad dreams.. Bout relo in France.
He decided to call them and found out that my cousin was really sick. She had a couple months left at the time

14/05/2014 5:27:22 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: So what r fallen angels

14/05/2014 5:28:03 pm: Paul Khum: Angles who have turned away from God

14/05/2014 5:28:28 pm: Paul Khum: Satan / the devil was once a angle who turned his back on God

14/05/2014 5:28:35 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Before or after death?

14/05/2014 5:29:09 pm: Paul Khum: Angles are immortal, they don't really have a death like us humans

14/05/2014 6:25:39 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Paul what's ur hair dressers name?

14/05/2014 6:33:27 pm: Paul Khum: Gabby

15/05/2014 7:25:29 am: Ponnorraks Ou: http://m.voanews.com/a/after-anti-china-protests-in-vietnam-chinese-flee-to-cambodia/1914509.html

15/05/2014 7:37:05 am: Paul Khum: Dam that's crazy

15/05/2014 7:37:06 am: Paul Khum: I read there was current tension between China and Vietnam

15/05/2014 7:37:27 am: Paul Khum: China has built a oil rig within Vietnam waters, to extract... You guessed it.... Oil!

15/05/2014 7:38:07 am: Khemarint Son: Lol

15/05/2014 7:38:12 am: Khemarint Son: Wow that's pretty ducked

15/05/2014 7:38:48 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Who determines the ownership of water?

15/05/2014 7:39:55 am: Ponnorraks Ou: There was an article last year..
There is heaps of oil untouched south of Cambodia, but Thailand is claiming a lot of the water area

15/05/2014 7:43:41 am: Marra Lim: I think BHP is in Cambodia. Not sure what they are mining for though

15/05/2014 7:47:28 am: Ponnorraks Ou: A good thing is Cambodia is developing.. Increase in tourist every year. Big plans for the next 5.. 10years.

Only prob is it's all at the expense of its own ppl.. Ppl still have no food, being evicted for development

15/05/2014 7:59:03 am: Paul Khum: Yeah its a dog eat dog world man, hustler style

15/05/2014 7:59:48 am: Paul Khum: Man actually don't know who determines who's the water belong to. I always assumed it was dependent on the proximity of the water from the coast line

15/05/2014 7:59:52 am: Ponnorraks Ou: ... Just went thru 3 pages of Cambodia news, having at least 3..4 murder cAses of foreign ppl

15/05/2014 8:00:35 am: Paul Khum: I. E 20kms from the coast of a country is there's, and it become international waters if more countries are close by like Asia

15/05/2014 8:04:24 am: Ponnorraks Ou: What about the areas of the neighbouring country

15/05/2014 8:06:49 am: Paul Khum: Yeah that's what I meant about international waters

15/05/2014 8:07:19 am: Paul Khum: Say if Thailand and Cambodia Coast like was within the same distance / proximity that it will become international waters

16/05/2014 8:15:44 am: Paul Khum: Yep done

16/05/2014 8:16:20 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Most prob not... Since his wedd is on 4/10.

16/05/2014 11:15:29 am: Khemarint Son: Terry -  think the main issue would be parking so that's why we decided on Fairfield

16/05/2014 11:15:57 am: Khemarint Son: I've checked the James. Bistro site again and that menu is the day time

16/05/2014 11:17:50 am: Terry So: Just thought it'd have a better atmosphere with the live music and food tents.

16/05/2014 11:17:53 am: Terry So: All good.

16/05/2014 11:18:05 am: Khemarint Son: They have an Al la carte menu for night (not up there atm)

16/05/2014 11:19:15 am: Khemarint Son: Yeah that's a good idea

16/05/2014 11:19:34 am: Khemarint Son: Maybe we should try a snazzy place sometime

16/05/2014 11:24:57 am: Terry So: You guys should try out the potting shed before it gets too cold. It's at the grounds of Alexandria. It's like an outdoor bar and the food is surprisingly good in comparison to the grounds.

16/05/2014 11:27:07 am: Paul Khum: I've seen heaps of people talk about this grounds of alexivandria

16/05/2014 11:27:22 am: Paul Khum: And marra mentioned it the last time

16/05/2014 11:27:23 am: Terry So: It looks good but man, my burger tasted like a $22 bigmac.

16/05/2014 11:27:41 am: Terry So: Coffee wasn't wow either.

16/05/2014 11:27:48 am: Paul Khum: Dam really?

16/05/2014 11:27:52 am: Terry So: But the place looks amazing.

16/05/2014 11:28:00 am: Paul Khum: Coffee never wows me Lol

16/05/2014 11:28:12 am: Terry So: Think you're drinking the wrong coffee.

16/05/2014 11:28:17 am: Paul Khum: I don't think I've ever had a coffee and said... "Fuck this is awesome...."

16/05/2014 11:28:37 am: Paul Khum: What's a good coffee place Victerry?

16/05/2014 11:28:39 am: Terry So: I've had that experience three times.

16/05/2014 11:29:02 am: Terry So: Coffee alchemy in marrickville. Smoothest coffee I've had.

16/05/2014 11:29:35 am: Paul Khum: What's your coffee Victerry?

16/05/2014 11:29:55 am: Terry So: Mecca on king st. Taste good, especially the foamy part.

16/05/2014 11:30:39 am: Terry So: Cabrito at the quay. I think they used chocolate powder or something but it's a lot sweeter than my usual soy mocha +1

16/05/2014 11:31:20 am: Paul Khum: Oh your a soy mocha man hey

16/05/2014 11:32:33 am: Khemarint Son: Ya I'm a coffee nub

16/05/2014 11:32:43 am: Khemarint Son: I only drank it probably less than 20 x my whole life

20/05/2014 9:34:43 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Didn't read it all.

20/05/2014 9:34:56 am: Khemarint Son: Isit same issues as before?

20/05/2014 9:35:41 am: Paul Khum: Yep just they've now got the army involved cause its getting out of hand....

20/05/2014 9:36:40 am: Paul Khum: Thailand in riots.... Chinese nationals running to Cambodia from Vietnam.....
Cambodia.... The place to be 😃

20/05/2014 9:39:12 am: Khemarint Son: Cambodia the new refugee resort

20/05/2014 9:39:35 am: Paul Khum: Hahah badly...

20/05/2014 9:39:58 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Maybe the Cambodians that went to Thailand 40years ago can return home

20/05/2014 9:41:53 am: Ponnorraks Ou: ... It sux coz I rekn theres Cambodians in Thailand or Vietnam who say they are Thai or viet and have left true origin behind.

20/05/2014 10:00:13 am: Paul Khum: Oh yeah, my mum knows a few people. They are Cambodian /Chinese. But when they came they just say they Chinese.

20/05/2014 11:31:35 am: Paul Khum: Everyone here have breakfast? What's for lunch today?

20/05/2014 12:00:13 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: On

20/05/2014 12:00:56 pm: Paul Khum: Buying?

20/05/2014 12:01:01 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Ye

20/05/2014 3:22:35 pm: Terry So: Quick question, do guys have white laptops?

20/05/2014 3:24:41 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah I guess so?

20/05/2014 3:24:58 pm: Paul Khum: Although I'm more of a black man

20/05/2014 3:26:04 pm: Paul Khum: What laptop are you looking at?

20/05/2014 3:37:32 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: What r u worried about.. With a white laptop?

20/05/2014 5:19:57 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Guys had white MacBooks ... When aluminium MacBooks weren't released yet

20/05/2014 5:26:03 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: http://m.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/cambodias-pm-hun-sen-confirms-controversial-agreement-to-resettle-refugees-from-australia-20140520-zrhz3.html

20/05/2014 5:27:32 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Australia is expected to give Cambodia tens of millions of dollars for accepting the refugees

20/05/2014 5:28:14 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: This is probably the reason why Hun sen will accept them...

Very silly of Australia to send these ppl Cambodia

20/05/2014 5:28:47 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah not really in the interests of genuine asylum seekers

20/05/2014 5:29:35 pm: Khemarint Son: Yep

20/05/2014 5:29:56 pm: Khemarint Son: The poverty stats of Cambodia are crazy

20/05/2014 5:30:37 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: "40 per cent of people live in poverty."

20/05/2014 5:32:00 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: "Mr Hun Sen acknowledged the country he has ruled with an iron first for more than three decades is one of the world’s poorest nations."

This should be enough for Australia to pull out

20/05/2014 5:35:17 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: .. Paul is this another one of Abbots silly ideas?

20/05/2014 5:56:57 pm: Paul Khum: Nah it's his way of washing his way clean of any liability with asylum seekers

20/05/2014 5:57:24 pm: Paul Khum: One of his pre election promise was to stop the boat (and reduce the country's debt)

20/05/2014 5:58:53 pm: Paul Khum: So I'm thinking the argument for this is .. If asylum seekers know they will go to Cambodia, it may make them think twice before getting on that boat and heading out to Australia

20/05/2014 6:01:00 pm: Paul Khum: But the funny thing  Hun Sen said 'they will only take refugees who want to go to Cambodia' .... What refugee would go to Cambodia if they have the option to be processed in Australia?

20/05/2014 6:01:42 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Maybe one day Cambodia will have the best looking chicks in the world. If they start mixing

20/05/2014 6:02:20 pm: Paul Khum: Lol we already have the best looking Chicks.....

20/05/2014 6:02:58 pm: Paul Khum: But yeah that's one positive thing that may happen

20/05/2014 6:03:06 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: So maybe he's saying "we'll take ur 10s of millions of $, but we're only accepting refugees willing to come"
Which is no one...

20/05/2014 6:03:20 pm: Paul Khum: Lol exactly!

20/05/2014 6:03:46 pm: Paul Khum: Like it just doesn't make sense

20/05/2014 6:04:18 pm: Khemarint Son: Lol

30/05/2014 8:24:50 am: Ponnorraks Ou: I bet they would get more $$ from the govt as we'll compare to livo

30/05/2014 8:27:37 am: Marra Lim: All of Tonys mates live there, so I guess he gotta look after his mates first

30/05/2014 8:28:15 am: Khemarint Son: Is anyone an abbot fan?

30/05/2014 8:28:24 am: Marra Lim: Paul

30/05/2014 8:28:27 am: Khemarint Son: Paul ur thoughts?

30/05/2014 8:28:29 am: Ponnorraks Ou: He's a dick

30/05/2014 8:28:30 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Haha

30/05/2014 8:28:46 am: Ponnorraks Ou: I'm don't care too much about politics

30/05/2014 8:29:02 am: Marra Lim: Hahah, to be fair: I think they are equally corrupt

30/05/2014 8:29:22 am: Marra Lim: If they can screw us, they will.

30/05/2014 8:30:56 am: Paul Khum: Wtf!

30/05/2014 8:31:24 am: Paul Khum: Fucken I haven't heard about this

30/05/2014 8:31:35 am: Paul Khum: Shit man. This is no way to start a Friday!

30/05/2014 8:31:43 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Dump that friend of ur man

30/05/2014 8:31:54 am: Paul Khum: That's a outrage

30/05/2014 9:44:34 am: Paul Khum: No not particularly a Abbott fan. But I probably did vote for these jokers in. Fair enough if they do this across the board for everyone.

30/05/2014 10:25:39 am: Terry So: I like tony :( I can't imagine what would have been happening if labour got in. Maybe it's a bad time for Australia and he's doing his best to fix what's been screwed up. Could've been worse. Could've been equally as bad but it's all on his name.

30/05/2014 10:27:46 am: Paul Khum: Hmm yeah its pretty hard. There cracking down on this welfare stuff bad.

30/05/2014 10:29:50 am: Paul Khum: <image omitted>

30/05/2014 11:24:00 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Damn
No wonder ppl talk shit bout ff all the time

30/05/2014 11:25:24 am: Paul Khum: Yeah man. It had the highest unemployment rate in the past, and still continues too

30/05/2014 11:28:21 am: Khemarint Son: Almost most shootings in Australia

30/05/2014 11:28:29 am: Khemarint Son: In 2011 I think

30/05/2014 11:28:29 am: Khemarint Son: Lol

30/05/2014 11:28:34 am: Khemarint Son: Also*

30/05/2014 11:29:13 am: Paul Khum: Lol Fuck the west is bad

30/05/2014 11:29:52 am: Paul Khum: I dont like that they're rolling this work for the dole scheme out in the west first.

30/05/2014 11:30:24 am: Paul Khum: But I understand that people in the north shore probably do pay more tax than those living in Western Sydney.

30/05/2014 11:30:28 am: Ponnorraks Ou: So what's the deal/ change in the dole?

30/05/2014 11:30:46 am: Khemarint Son: Few things

30/05/2014 11:31:00 am: Khemarint Son: U gotta work for the dole now (in the areas on that lodt)

30/05/2014 11:31:03 am: Khemarint Son: List *

30/05/2014 11:31:11 am: Khemarint Son: 15 hours a week

30/05/2014 11:31:19 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Which is fair

30/05/2014 11:31:25 am: Khemarint Son: U can't claim the dole for 6 months

30/05/2014 11:31:29 am: Khemarint Son: If ur under 30

30/05/2014 11:31:41 am: Khemarint Son: I think this one's  pretty harsh

30/05/2014 11:31:52 am: Paul Khum: That's very harsh

30/05/2014 11:32:24 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Can only claim for 6 months?

30/05/2014 11:32:30 am: Khemarint Son: No u can't claim

30/05/2014 11:32:37 am: Khemarint Son: Until 6 months has expired

30/05/2014 11:32:46 am: Khemarint Son: So if u lose ur job

30/05/2014 11:32:50 am: Khemarint Son: Ur fucked for a while

30/05/2014 11:32:55 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Ur have to wait 6 months?

30/05/2014 11:33:03 am: Khemarint Son: Ya

30/05/2014 11:33:04 am: Paul Khum: So say terry loses his job. He has to wait 6 months. Then apply for the dole

30/05/2014 11:33:15 am: Paul Khum: That's fucked seriously guys

30/05/2014 11:33:37 am: Paul Khum: I have moved around a few times in my working  years.

30/05/2014 11:33:37 am: Khemarint Son: Ya I live at home so I'd survive

30/05/2014 11:33:52 am: Khemarint Son: But plenty of people already pay cheque to cheque

30/05/2014 11:34:02 am: Khemarint Son: That would crush them if they were made redundant

30/05/2014 11:34:05 am: Paul Khum: Yeah myself for one...

30/05/2014 11:34:25 am: Paul Khum: I have been made redundant too. It was Fucked... During the gfc in 2008

30/05/2014 11:34:47 am: Paul Khum: Seriously it was hard to bounce back. I needed help for abit

30/05/2014 11:35:02 am: Paul Khum: The first 6 months is critical to finding a job

30/05/2014 11:35:26 am: Paul Khum: Not having the money to do so would make it hard to even go for interviews.

30/05/2014 11:35:53 am: Paul Khum: The longer you are unemployed. The harder it becomes (sometimes) to get a job

30/05/2014 11:36:00 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Yeh that one is harsh
They should allow it if ppl have a record of working

30/05/2014 11:36:10 am: Paul Khum: Yea exactly!

30/05/2014 11:36:22 am: Ponnorraks Ou: But I agree ppl should have to work for the dole...

30/05/2014 11:36:29 am: Ponnorraks Ou: At least ones with no workin history

30/05/2014 11:36:39 am: Paul Khum: Fair enough there are people on the dole for ages, but those newly affected will be fucked.

30/05/2014 11:37:50 am: Terry So: Damn, that is a hard hit.

30/05/2014 11:36:57 am: Paul Khum: Like I was never on the doll for more than 6 months.

30/05/2014 11:37:10 am: Khemarint Son: Ya I like the work for the dole type

30/05/2014 11:37:14 am: Khemarint Son: Rule *

30/05/2014 11:37:15 am: Paul Khum: And even then 6months felt like eternity.... (good times but....)

30/05/2014 11:37:25 am: Khemarint Son: U Can learn some skills which help u get back into the work force

30/05/2014 11:37:59 am: Paul Khum: Yea probably phils motivate people to work too. Getting back into the routine of working is hard.

30/05/2014 11:40:14 am: Paul Khum: I agree with people who are on long term unemployment benefits to work for the dole. But not sure about the short term people.

30/05/2014 11:40:33 am: Paul Khum: Because the first couple of months will be critical in getting a job in your field.

30/05/2014 11:41:06 am: Paul Khum: Imagine if anyone of us was made redundant. And you had to work for the dole. You would probably take the first job offer that comes to you (which is what they want)

30/05/2014 11:41:15 am: Paul Khum: But long term you'll suffer.

30/05/2014 11:45:01 am: Khemarint Son: Yeah I agree

30/05/2014 11:45:13 am: Khemarint Son: Should be giving 3_6 month grace

30/05/2014 11:47:47 am: Paul Khum: Yeah exactly! Then deal with them if they become long term unemployed. But to say NO BENIFITS FOR 6MONTHS. Man that's harsh

30/05/2014 11:48:11 am: Terry So: I think six months is too long...

30/05/2014 11:49:04 am: Paul Khum: Yeah its long man...

30/05/2014 11:49:12 am: Terry So: It's just like now, first thing you save for is unemployment security

30/05/2014 12:00:12 pm: Khemarint Son: Haha that is actually a tip for everyone

30/05/2014 12:00:26 pm: Khemarint Son: They say ur supposed to have 6 months worth of bills etc saved in case

30/05/2014 12:01:50 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah that is a good tip actually. I think jen and I could cope for 6 months if one of us lost our jobs.

30/05/2014 12:02:01 pm: Paul Khum: But it would be pretty tough to be honest.

30/05/2014 12:02:58 pm: Khemarint Son: Just enough liquid assets to cover 6 months

30/05/2014 4:13:37 pm: Marra Lim: I would let mind working for the dole if they paid 1k a week and you only have to work a 20 hr week

30/05/2014 4:31:17 pm: Paul Khum: Lol marra! Clearly you haven't been on the dole.

30/05/2014 4:32:00 pm: Paul Khum: They pay you $500 a fortnight?

30/05/2014 4:32:53 pm: Paul Khum: And they want you to work 15 hours a week.

30/05/2014 4:36:15 pm: Khemarint Son: 1k a week lol

30/05/2014 4:36:19 pm: Khemarint Son: That's heaps

30/05/2014 4:36:29 pm: Paul Khum: Lol it is...

30/05/2014 4:36:47 pm: Paul Khum: If quit my job today if it was paying that much...

30/05/2014 4:37:32 pm: Marra Lim: Yeah. It worked out to be $50 bucks an hour

30/05/2014 4:37:39 pm: Khemarint Son: Compo gets about 700 a week flat

30/05/2014 4:37:42 pm: Marra Lim: To be on the dole

30/05/2014 4:37:49 pm: Khemarint Son: No matter what u were earning before

30/05/2014 4:38:18 pm: Paul Khum: Shit man 700 would be good

30/05/2014 4:38:19 pm: Marra Lim: How much you get on a disability pension. ?

30/05/2014 4:40:13 pm: Khemarint Son: 700 is crazy good if u were working party time

30/05/2014 4:40:22 pm: Khemarint Son: Lots of people try to cheat em

31/05/2014 10:30:34 pm: Marra Lim: http://mobile.news.com.au/lifestyle/food/sriracha-is-the-worlds-hottest-sauce-right-now-as-fans-celebrate-the-end-of-srirachapocalypse/story-fneuz8zj-1226938178873

31/05/2014 10:31:05 pm: Marra Lim: I'm not much of a chilli lover so it won't affect me as much. You guys like chilli?

31/05/2014 10:46:03 pm: Khemarint Son: It says it's over

31/05/2014 10:46:13 pm: Khemarint Son: There not going through any more issues

31/05/2014 10:46:31 pm: Khemarint Son: Sricha the biggest success story ever

31/05/2014 10:46:57 pm: Khemarint Son: Made by a vietnamese guy that went to USA (our parents generation)

31/05/2014 10:47:22 pm: Marra Lim: I didn't realise how big the product was. But anywhere pho is sold, so is this product

31/05/2014 10:47:33 pm: Khemarint Son: Every Asian store man

31/05/2014 10:47:37 pm: Khemarint Son: Huge!

31/05/2014 10:47:58 pm: Marra Lim: Yeah, I noticed it everywhere in Sandiego as well.

31/05/2014 10:48:39 pm: Marra Lim: I would be pretty pissed off too if their factory was next door to my house

31/05/2014 10:49:01 pm: Marra Lim: I'm sure the man has the funds to relocate.

2/06/2014 9:19:26 am: Paul Khum: Man I hate working guys....

2/06/2014 9:19:41 am: Paul Khum: I was so close to calling in dead today for work...

2/06/2014 9:20:16 am: Khemarint Son: Same

2/06/2014 9:20:19 am: Khemarint Son: Terrible sleep

2/06/2014 9:21:47 am: Paul Khum: Yep... I'm so not a morning person man...

2/06/2014 9:22:07 am: Paul Khum: And speaking of that Chili sauce, it's massive! Which reminds me I need to restock

2/06/2014 9:28:39 am: Ponnorraks Ou: <image omitted>

2/06/2014 9:29:03 am: Paul Khum: What's this ponno?

2/06/2014 9:29:20 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Fund raising for vision Cambodia

2/06/2014 9:14:30 pm: Marra Lim: Frame it , tell your kids about it

3/06/2014 3:02:08 pm: Paul Khum: <image omitted>

3/06/2014 3:02:21 pm: Paul Khum: This kid has bigger shoulders than me!

3/06/2014 3:26:15 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Coz he's black

3/06/2014 3:42:09 pm: Paul Khum: Lol

5/06/2014 1:25:37 pm: Marra Lim: Everyone at work today?

5/06/2014 1:49:53 pm: Terry So: Yeah. Studying more like it

5/06/2014 2:12:53 pm: Marra Lim: I called in sick today to go to a job interview. Then went to St. John's park doctors and asked for a doctors note. South American looking doctor decline to give me a note. As I told her the truth. First time a doctor has decline to give me a letter.

5/06/2014 2:13:38 pm: Marra Lim: Then I called another driver, who advised me I don't need a note for 1 day off. I wait at the docs for nothing

5/06/2014 2:14:56 pm: Marra Lim: I went to St. John's park docs before and the lady wrote out a note for me, no questions asked. But I rocked up in a suit today and she prob thinks I'm under cover today.

5/06/2014 2:28:18 pm: Khemarint Son: Why would u tell them the truth nigga!

5/06/2014 2:28:19 pm: Khemarint Son: Lol

5/06/2014 2:29:19 pm: Paul Khum: Omg marra....

5/06/2014 2:29:31 pm: Paul Khum: Hahah

5/06/2014 2:29:57 pm: Paul Khum: I got a few temples at home that I need to look for.... If not I can give you one if needed

5/06/2014 2:30:21 pm: Paul Khum: I even got the ones that the hospital gives out (don't ask me how I got it)  Haha

5/06/2014 2:31:01 pm: Paul Khum: Should of said you had a migraine.... Like all women do when they have their rags

5/06/2014 2:32:04 pm: Khemarint Son: What was the interview for?

5/06/2014 2:32:07 pm: Khemarint Son: How did u go

5/06/2014 3:08:28 pm: Marra Lim: Garbo collector

5/06/2014 3:08:37 pm: Paul Khum: Bs.....

5/06/2014 3:08:50 pm: Paul Khum: Seriously marra?

5/06/2014 3:09:10 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Silliest thing ever...

5/06/2014 3:09:21 pm: Marra Lim: Well it kinda is sort of. The advertisement sugar coated the job

5/06/2014 3:09:36 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Telling the doctor u went for a job interview

5/06/2014 3:09:54 pm: Marra Lim: Haha, I've done it before and got away with it

5/06/2014 3:10:14 pm: Marra Lim: I rock up, tell the truth. Get what I need and leave. Saves everyone time.

5/06/2014 3:10:47 pm: Marra Lim: I think the young doc was worried I was an inspector as I rocked up in a suit

5/06/2014 3:11:36 pm: Marra Lim: The job is collection of chemicals. There is a waste division, but they need chemical handlers

5/06/2014 3:12:04 pm: Marra Lim: Apparently people pay to throw motor oil away.

5/06/2014 3:12:34 pm: Marra Lim: Did you know milk is classified as hazardous.

5/06/2014 3:13:28 pm: Marra Lim: Disposal of milk. You need to call hazmat team, if there is a leak . You can't pour it down the drain as it will clog up the pipes

5/06/2014 3:13:34 pm: Marra Lim: So they say

5/06/2014 3:14:15 pm: Marra Lim: I'm still going through the though process of whether I want the job or not.

5/06/2014 3:14:31 pm: Marra Lim: I just hate my current job now and looking for an out.

5/06/2014 3:16:37 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah I wouldn't know how to dispose of motor oil normally. I think mechanic actually do pay for someone to collect it.. Motor oil is pretty bad...

5/06/2014 3:16:58 pm: Paul Khum: So with this new role.. Does it require you to drive a truck still?

5/06/2014 3:19:05 pm: Marra Lim: Yeah, it does. I've asked all the questions. And they fall under the same EBA as waste disposal. Even though I don't touch waste.

5/06/2014 3:19:47 pm: Paul Khum: But you'll be handling chemicals?

5/06/2014 3:19:53 pm: Marra Lim: It's mainly commercial contracts. I'm a bit nervous about moving from tnt as I've been with them for 6 years

5/06/2014 3:19:59 pm: Marra Lim: Yeah.

5/06/2014 3:20:01 pm: Paul Khum: Cuz we need a catch up... Wtf..

5/06/2014 3:20:19 pm: Marra Lim: I asked if I need a dg license ( dangerous goods). They said no

5/06/2014 3:21:01 pm: Paul Khum: The word chemical is quite vague

5/06/2014 3:21:02 pm: Marra Lim: Yeah. We should catch up . I don't think my new gig is too much to brag about though. It's just a lifestyle change.

5/06/2014 3:21:40 pm: Marra Lim: Yeah it is. Thankfully it's a 7am start, and my OT kicks in earlier . Which is my motive for this job

5/06/2014 3:21:57 pm: Marra Lim: And they have the option of working weekends if I want more cash

5/06/2014 3:22:03 pm: Paul Khum: Cuz I'm a desk jockey..... No overtime.... Not much to brag about my role either Haha

5/06/2014 7:01:56 pm: Khemarint Son: Good example of the power of compounding

5/06/2014 7:02:04 pm: Khemarint Son: <image omitted>

5/06/2014 7:08:00 pm: Marra Lim: It makes it really transparent the way it's set out.

5/06/2014 7:08:09 pm: Khemarint Son: Ya let's have a catch up soon marra

5/06/2014 7:08:32 pm: Khemarint Son: U leaning towards taking the new job?

5/06/2014 7:08:39 pm: Marra Lim: I'm up for it.

5/06/2014 7:09:01 pm: Marra Lim: Yeah, I am. I'm starting to dread my job at the moment.

5/06/2014 7:09:13 pm: Marra Lim: The feeling been there for the last 2 weeks.

5/06/2014 7:09:42 pm: Khemarint Son: U don't have to commit to anything so soon

5/06/2014 7:09:50 pm: Khemarint Son: Keep checking job boards

5/06/2014 7:09:55 pm: Khemarint Son: See what else is out there

5/06/2014 7:10:30 pm: Marra Lim: I get along with everyone from work. Other drivers are trying to talk me out of leaving.

They believe the feeling is just a phase. I do to. But I want more money as we'll.

5/06/2014 7:10:55 pm: Marra Lim: The new job, requires me to work harder. But I will be making more money.

5/06/2014 7:11:31 pm: Marra Lim: I've been trying to get into trailers at tnt. But then keep hooking up their Samoan cousins. so I got no chance there

5/06/2014 7:12:36 pm: Marra Lim: It's tough for us cambo's to excel in a corporate environment where there is a white culture. You need to be one of them.

5/06/2014 7:12:47 pm: Khemarint Son: Ya that's how it is

5/06/2014 7:13:05 pm: Khemarint Son: Do U want to drive lsrge trucks?

5/06/2014 7:13:07 pm: Marra Lim: Or offer a really good labour

5/06/2014 7:13:17 pm: Khemarint Son: Got a mate who does it now under his dad

5/06/2014 7:13:24 pm: Khemarint Son: Apparently makes good cos

5/06/2014 7:13:26 pm: Khemarint Son: Coin

5/06/2014 7:13:38 pm: Khemarint Son: Can ask about it if u want

5/06/2014 7:14:52 pm: Marra Lim: I don't mind about the size. I want the money. Because we/ I am young now. And want to pump the labour whilst I'm still fit

5/06/2014 7:15:39 pm: Marra Lim: Yeah. Ask the question. Tell him I got the HC UNRESTRICTED license. With 3 years experience.

5/06/2014 7:16:38 pm: Marra Lim: With the trucking game: it's not the bigger the vehicle the more money. It's the better the contracts, the better return.

5/06/2014 7:17:09 pm: Marra Lim: Some toll (security work), make 5k a week. Just using a van.

5/06/2014 7:18:15 pm: Marra Lim: That's because they saw an opportunity to buy a run. They knew the run was going to be saturated with work, then they divide the run up and subcontract it out.

5/06/2014 7:19:35 pm: Marra Lim: There are some blokes driving HC on $18/ hour. I don't know how that is legal. But that's what they get paid.

5/06/2014 10:20:30 pm: Khemarint Son: U seem like u known a lot about the industry

5/06/2014 10:20:38 pm: Khemarint Son: Could u get ur own run goin on

5/06/2014 10:36:39 pm: Paul Khum: I would say the $18 is legal, it might not be part of the union so they're going to get paid less.
Yeah I reckon getting your own run would be awesome, but you'd know all about that

6/06/2014 7:42:26 am: Marra Lim: You can get your own run going. Buying a run is like buying any business. It's up to you to ask the right questions to identify an opportunity or a dud.

6/06/2014 7:44:48 am: Marra Lim: $18 buck is legal. But if you know your rights and willing to fight. You can be paid more. But then again, it might be easier to just leave. E.g what's stopping your employer paying you 40k a year. More than likely it's regulation rather than good will of the owner/ share holder of the company.

6/06/2014 7:50:16 am: Paul Khum: Yeah I don't think these guys on 18 a hour are in the union? No way would anyone get paid 18 an hour if they had a hc license

6/06/2014 8:02:59 am: Marra Lim: It depends on the EBA that is negotiated. Who negotiates it, and how it's negotiated. Just because a place is heavily unionised, doesn't necessarily mean they are going to get paid more. (Union can also be corrupt). But usually when a place is heavily unionised they are paid more, with better working conditions.

6/06/2014 8:05:01 am: Marra Lim: If you look at the maccas concept. They are on a low rate. Once you get off the EBA and go on individual contracts to become a manager ( "move up") then it becomes more ambiguous.

6/06/2014 8:06:20 am: Paul Khum: Individual contracts in my experience generally resulted in lower wages... I. E my job 😢

6/06/2014 8:06:37 am: Marra Lim: The gov lets them get away with it. As overall, they bring in more tax revenue to the country then the average small business. But kids love working there as it's a brand name. And they are cleaver enough to make the job a little fun and hip

6/06/2014 8:06:45 am: Paul Khum: I think people at maccas get paid alright? Not sure how much though Lol

6/06/2014 8:06:59 am: Khemarint Son: They get paid pretty decent tbh

6/06/2014 8:07:14 am: Khemarint Son: My mate got paid in the 20 pH 4 years ago

6/06/2014 8:07:19 am: Marra Lim: Realistically, once you get to that stage. I.e your situation. It's an open market.

6/06/2014 8:07:26 am: Khemarint Son: It's age adjusted

6/06/2014 8:07:57 am: Khemarint Son: At our age hospitality gets paid a decent minimum

6/06/2014 8:08:22 am: Khemarint Son: My mate who owns a lewrap had to do side deals with international students.

6/06/2014 8:08:41 am: Khemarint Son: Otherwise he couldn't keep up with the costs

6/06/2014 8:08:43 am: Marra Lim: I think they deserved it to.

6/06/2014 8:09:13 am: Marra Lim: The setup he had got is currently good. Till someone snitches.

6/06/2014 8:09:45 am: Marra Lim: It will be stressful, if it's not sustainable.

6/06/2014 8:10:15 am: Paul Khum: Man 20 is fucken good for maccas! Even for today's rate! And that's 4 years ago... Fuck bcc

6/06/2014 8:10:18 am: Marra Lim: But short term it work, so let it be

6/06/2014 8:10:45 am: Marra Lim: You sure it's 20, I don't believe it

6/06/2014 8:10:54 am: Marra Lim: As adult wage I do

6/06/2014 8:10:59 am: Marra Lim: But not minimum wage

6/06/2014 8:11:05 am: Paul Khum: The liberals want individual contracts. Labor wants unions.

6/06/2014 8:11:18 am: Khemarint Son: That's not minimum

6/06/2014 8:11:24 am: Khemarint Son: It was just the pay he got

6/06/2014 8:11:42 am: Khemarint Son: Let me. Ask my other mate what's minimum.

6/06/2014 8:12:09 am: Marra Lim: If his got a side deal with the area manager or something good on him. I'll take it to if I could

6/06/2014 8:12:27 am: Khemarint Son: No the side deal is at the lewrap

6/06/2014 8:12:45 am: Khemarint Son: Coz international students can only work a max amount of hours per week

6/06/2014 8:12:54 am: Khemarint Son: So he gave them. More hours at ultimately less rates

6/06/2014 8:16:14 am: Khemarint Son: Ok so just checked current min wage for adults in hospitality he reckons is about 21

6/06/2014 8:16:25 am: Khemarint Son: Will have a source soon

6/06/2014 8:16:43 am: Marra Lim: Yeah. That's usually the case.  The security that work for tnt, at the gate house does 12-14 hour days but at 22 bucks an hour. But with their shift allowance, they make more than the average. As it goes into time and a half/ and double .

6/06/2014 8:16:48 am: Paul Khum: Yeah that's what the liberals want. People to hustle and work out their own rates. Rather than have a standard rate all around.

6/06/2014 8:17:16 am: Marra Lim: It's a messed up world, things are never really fair. You just got to shop around for the best deal available

6/06/2014 8:18:34 am: Marra Lim: I remember: a member of lib party said the super should be negotiated between employer and employee. (I'm thinking you fucken kidding me). There is no negotiation...

6/06/2014 8:18:49 am: Marra Lim: This is when they were arguing 9-12%

6/06/2014 8:19:11 am: Khemarint Son: I think that's good

6/06/2014 8:19:11 am: Khemarint Son: 9 minimum

6/06/2014 8:19:25 am: Khemarint Son: But employer can put up more as a job Incentive

6/06/2014 8:22:01 am: Paul Khum: I thought they were increasing it to 12% as a minimum?

6/06/2014 8:22:13 am: Khemarint Son: Really

6/06/2014 8:22:19 am: Khemarint Son: That's a big jump

6/06/2014 8:22:47 am: Khemarint Son: Check. Out this chart again

6/06/2014 8:23:03 am: Ponnorraks Ou: I was on $13 at Oporto

6/06/2014 8:23:04 am: Khemarint Son: The growth rate they used is 12%

6/06/2014 8:23:06 am: Khemarint Son: <image omitted>

6/06/2014 8:23:08 am: Paul Khum: Yeah over the next few years... Slowly phasing it to 12%. I'll have to confirm this..

6/06/2014 8:23:25 am: Khemarint Son: Reasonable deduction if u factor in the tax benefits of super

6/06/2014 8:36:44 am: Khemarint Son: <image omitted>

6/06/2014 8:39:25 am: Khemarint Son: Pretty high man

6/06/2014 8:45:17 am: Paul Khum: Dam man that is high....

6/06/2014 8:45:32 am: Paul Khum: Makes me think why I even went to uni..... 😔

6/06/2014 1:55:18 pm: Paul Khum: I guess they didn't inform people that this was happening... As we all know people would freak out about it.

6/06/2014 1:56:11 pm: Khemarint Son: Been getting flu shot last few years

6/06/2014 1:56:21 pm: Khemarint Son: Feel like it's worth it

6/06/2014 1:56:44 pm: Khemarint Son: Only had full blown flu once or twice in about 4 years

6/06/2014 2:01:48 pm: Paul Khum: Did you get the flu shot on those years?

6/06/2014 2:02:52 pm: Khemarint Son: Yep got it 4 years

6/06/2014 2:03:01 pm: Khemarint Son: Flu shots only3 strains

10/06/2014 1:55:31 pm: Paul Khum: Nah it has like a circular shoot/funnel and you put the fruit in it and it turns it all I to juice

10/06/2014 2:39:27 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah the rain is as bad this morning.

11/06/2014 9:43:33 am: Paul Khum: Alright so I'm trying to hook Steven up with a job here. I hope he gets it, but Fuck better make be look good

11/06/2014 9:57:06 am: Marra Lim: Good luck with that.

11/06/2014 10:14:40 am: Paul Khum: Yeah I hope it works out

11/06/2014 10:14:54 am: Paul Khum: I hope I don't get blamed for crushing his hopes and dreams

11/06/2014 11:04:36 am: Paul Khum: You guys realise it's been about a year since we last played tennis?

11/06/2014 11:04:57 am: Ponnorraks Ou: A year and a few months

11/06/2014 11:05:05 am: Paul Khum: We stopped before winter last year because it was getting cold, now it's going into winter again...

12/06/2014 5:58:21 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: There's like 20 officers checking tickets at Fairfield

12/06/2014 5:59:02 pm: Marra Lim: That's good for your investment home.

12/06/2014 6:00:03 pm: Marra Lim: Domino effect..

12/06/2014 6:07:18 pm: Paul Khum: How is that good for the investment home?

12/06/2014 6:19:25 pm: Marra Lim: Well parking inspectors are employees of the council. As they issue tickets, that's revenue for the council. That revenue helps build infrastructure, which promotes activities. I.e business, parks , public toilets.

As there is more activity in an area, more people would want to live there as there are jobs, nice parks.

Therefore there this increases the demand for property.

12/06/2014 8:57:56 pm: Marra Lim: If you buy a product with a 2 year warranty and it breaks down within 2 years, you will be given a replacement. If the replacement breaks down after 2 years of the initial purchase, some companies may choose not to provide a replacement. As they may argue that the warranty doesn't reset.

According to ACCC: guarantee of acceptable quality should start again once you get a replacement. Even if the company claims, their warranty doesn't.

If you want the item replaced>>>

Go back: tell them they are in breach of section 264 of subdivision A, division 1 of Part 5-4, chapter 5, of schedule 2 of competition and consumer law.

13/06/2014 3:41:25 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah he's got to start somewhere. I just spoke to him just then, he doesn't sound very assertive Lol

17/06/2014 5:36:27 pm: Khemarint Son: And what macros are (protein fat carbs)

17/06/2014 5:37:11 pm: Khemarint Son: It happens over time.

17/06/2014 5:37:20 pm: Khemarint Son: Start increasing slowly

17/06/2014 5:39:36 pm: Khemarint Son: Bit like fat people who start losing weight -  eating habits take time to change

19/06/2014 3:43:53 pm: Paul Khum: http://shotexpo.com.au/sydney-expo/

19/06/2014 3:45:25 pm: Khemarint Son: I might wanna go

19/06/2014 3:48:44 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah I want to get my gun license soon... Both riffle and pistol.... I know which pistol I already want... Still looking around for a nice rifle

19/06/2014 3:50:46 pm: Paul Khum: <image omitted>

19/06/2014 3:50:59 pm: Paul Khum: Say hello to my little friend.....

19/06/2014 4:12:59 pm: Khemarint Son: I shot some. Guns in Cambodia

19/06/2014 4:13:12 pm: Khemarint Son: But they were kinds shit maintained

19/06/2014 4:13:13 pm: Khemarint Son: Ak47

19/06/2014 4:13:16 pm: Khemarint Son: And some other one

19/06/2014 4:13:26 pm: Khemarint Son: Wanna try a shotty

19/06/2014 4:36:34 pm: Terry So: Don't see why you need a gun. You haven't ever needed it for almost thirty years

19/06/2014 4:46:56 pm: Paul Khum: Very true, but you've never needed a first aid kit either, doesn't mean you won't need it sometime in the future

19/06/2014 4:47:49 pm: Khemarint Son: LOL

19/06/2014 4:48:14 pm: Khemarint Son: Prob not a good idea for u to get a gun

19/06/2014 4:49:04 pm: Paul Khum: But I'm taking up a new hobby / sport. Target shooting.... Hand eye coordination 😊

19/06/2014 4:50:01 pm: Paul Khum: See first was gym with khem and pon....
Now I've just had my first karting session with pon...
Next will be target shooting.
Followed by dancing with usher

19/06/2014 5:12:37 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Nx is rock climbing with all of us

19/06/2014 5:12:50 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: <image omitted>

19/06/2014 5:15:10 pm: Paul Khum: Ye that's right pon, next is rock climbing...

19/06/2014 5:16:20 pm: Khemarint Son: Terry u coming.

19/06/2014 5:20:08 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Terry's got a date

19/06/2014 5:38:49 pm: Paul Khum: That's lunch time.. 😄 he can come for one hour?

19/06/2014 8:47:19 pm: Terry So: If the firing range is your new hobby, why do you need a gun? Not like pon went out to buy a gokart.

19/06/2014 8:48:30 pm: Paul Khum: You need a gun to fire at the range

19/06/2014 8:48:58 pm: Terry So: Don't they have their own to use at the place?

19/06/2014 8:49:47 pm: Paul Khum: They supply the go karts for you when you go karting, your not allowed to bring your own kart.
Yes there are some places where you can bring your kart. But that's another level

19/06/2014 8:50:45 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah you can probably rent a gun, and fire it. But it won't be the gun I like... It will fire diffent, handle diffent, etc

19/06/2014 8:51:18 pm: Paul Khum: Like I want to buy a helmet for karting, they do supply them. I'd just like one to call my own you know?

19/06/2014 8:52:10 pm: Paul Khum: But what do you reckon of that gun? Sexy Yeah?

19/06/2014 8:58:23 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Where's Marra...

19/06/2014 9:01:08 pm: Khemarint Son: Lol

19/06/2014 9:01:17 pm: Khemarint Son: I agree with terry sentiment here

19/06/2014 9:02:07 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: My only comment is.. We don't need anymore guns on these streets

19/06/2014 9:09:52 pm: Paul Khum: These won't be on the streets, they will be in my house

19/06/2014 9:11:19 pm: Paul Khum: When a few seconds counts. The police are only a few minutes away 🚓

19/06/2014 9:13:32 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Same thing.. on the streets, in a house..
Your just adding to the problem. More guns in Australia.
Are u saying we should all have one, when a few seconds count ?

19/06/2014 9:15:31 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah I reckon we should all have one

19/06/2014 9:24:34 pm: Paul Khum: Anyone that commits a crime with a gun deserves to be put away, doesn't matter if it's with a gun a knife or a fist

19/06/2014 10:06:54 pm: Paul Khum: <image omitted>

19/06/2014 10:07:40 pm: Paul Khum: I'm liking this rifle.. Lever action

19/06/2014 10:13:48 pm: Terry So: If you think we should all have one, check out America and how many get killed by guns a year. Just cause people like you, think it's sexy?

19/06/2014 10:14:16 pm: Terry So: First you say you want it for the firing range.

19/06/2014 10:14:26 pm: Terry So: Now you're saying you're protecting yourself

19/06/2014 11:06:54 pm: Paul Khum: Pharmaceutical drugs kill more people than hand guns, more crimes are committed by knifes than hand guns.
What do you want to do get rid of all knifes as well?

19/06/2014 11:07:21 pm: Paul Khum: The gun crime rate has actually dropped in the USA, main stream media won't tell you this.

19/06/2014 11:09:16 pm: Paul Khum: Switzerland, everyone house hold has a gun. Yet it has the lowest crime rate in the world.

19/06/2014 11:10:25 pm: Paul Khum: In some states of the USA. Where you are allowed to openly carry a gun. The crime rate is actually lower there. Than states that ban guns. Or don't allow open carry

19/06/2014 11:10:57 pm: Paul Khum: Open carry is pretty much being able to carry your gun around in people sight. Like having it holsters on your shoulder.

19/06/2014 11:11:53 pm: Paul Khum: Why is the crime rate lower in those states? Because no one is going to mess with you if they know you have a gun.

19/06/2014 11:14:04 pm: Paul Khum: Look I know I use to think the same as you terry. In time you will see, young padawan.

19/06/2014 11:35:20 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: So much I wanna comment on this, but won't even waste my time.
I'm with terry

19/06/2014 11:40:42 pm: Paul Khum: Lol that's alright man, I understand I was the same.

20/06/2014 4:40:47 am: Khemarint Son: Lol?

20/06/2014 4:41:07 am: Khemarint Son: The first comment is prob one of the worst arguments ever

20/06/2014 4:43:36 am: Khemarint Son: It's a bit like Jens one "did u know that an Australian dies every second day in Bali????"

20/06/2014 4:44:02 am: Khemarint Son: Well. No. Shit it's coz there's millions. Going there every year!

20/06/2014 4:45:53 am: Khemarint Son: I won't comment to much on this as I know you love to nit pick data to suit your own agenda and won't listen to logic when presented

20/06/2014 10:00:33 am: Paul Khum: Lol how is saying millions of people go to Bali every year any diffent to nit picking data to suit your agenda? I'm sure millions of people go to Europe and the USA every year too, but probably doesn't have the same death rate as Bali.

20/06/2014 10:04:17 am: Khemarint Son: No it was 2 unrelated comments

20/06/2014 10:04:30 am: Khemarint Son: Ur first comment about pharmaccuticlas killing more than gins

20/06/2014 10:04:32 am: Khemarint Son: No shit!

20/06/2014 10:04:49 am: Khemarint Son: That's because everyone uses pharmaceuticals!

20/06/2014 10:04:51 am: Paul Khum: Yeah but you don't hear about it on the news do you?

20/06/2014 10:05:00 am: Khemarint Son: Same as knives!

20/06/2014 10:05:05 am: Khemarint Son: Literally everyone has one

20/06/2014 10:05:17 am: Khemarint Son: Of course the numbers will be higher

20/06/2014 10:05:42 am: Khemarint Son: That's what I was saying about Jens comment

20/06/2014 10:05:42 am: Paul Khum: Exactly so what are you going to do? Complain about knifes?

20/06/2014 10:13:27 am: Khemarint Son: No use discussion a topic like this with u as it goes nowhere lol

20/06/2014 10:15:21 am: Paul Khum: You can't change someone's mind in 30mins, so don't try. Lol Dw it will take time

20/06/2014 10:16:54 am: Khemarint Son: To me. This sounds like another conspiracy theory about govs cracking down on guns?

20/06/2014 10:16:58 am: Khemarint Son: Can u confirm this?

20/06/2014 10:26:10 am: Paul Khum: Well let's take a step back and look at history.
Mao Zedong, pol pot, Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler..
All of them have something in common.
They all cracked down on guns at the start..
Then pretty much after fucked everyone up because people couldn't defend them selves any more.

20/06/2014 10:26:54 am: Paul Khum: I can't actually talk about "conspiracy theories " until next financial year... As per Pons request earlier.

20/06/2014 10:27:23 am: Khemarint Son: What about John Howard

20/06/2014 10:27:32 am: Khemarint Son: Cracked. Down on guns

20/06/2014 10:27:38 am: Paul Khum: Correct he started...

20/06/2014 10:29:18 am: Paul Khum: After the incident in port Arthur. I honestly believe that this event was staged. In a bid to start cracking down on guns.

20/06/2014 10:29:32 am: Khemarint Son: Haha ok

20/06/2014 10:29:36 am: Paul Khum: But ill go into that next financial year....

20/06/2014 10:29:40 am: Khemarint Son: No more conspiracy talk till next year r

20/06/2014 10:29:47 am: Khemarint Son: Good rule. Pon

20/06/2014 10:36:31 am: Paul Khum: Yes its true, USA have a gun crime problem. But let's look at stats here. Hey have more guns per capita, so fair enough crimes are going to happen. Just like the Bali death thing...
But what about  Australia? We've cracked down gun heaps since port Arthur... But evey single week there almost a shooting in Sydney alone.
So in actual fact Australia has more gun relates crimes than the USA per capita.
USA have more guns than Australia.
USA have a much larger population than Aus.
USA is 310 million? Australia is 22 million.
Yet Australia still have gun related crime.

20/06/2014 10:37:46 am: Terry So: Staged? You watch too many movies or read too much bullshit.

20/06/2014 10:38:17 am: Khemarint Son: Australia doesn't have. Higher gun incidence per  capita

20/06/2014 10:38:31 am: Paul Khum: Hey its on the news so it must be right?

20/06/2014 10:38:39 am: Khemarint Son: No its a stay

20/06/2014 10:38:39 am: Terry So: There's more fun violence in America. It happens every day. No need to shove another gunshot on the news. . We have one per week and it goes on the news BECAUSE it's banned.

20/06/2014 10:38:40 am: Khemarint Son: Stay

20/06/2014 10:38:42 am: Khemarint Son: Stat

20/06/2014 10:38:57 am: Khemarint Son: Australia is amongst the lowest in the world per capita

20/06/2014 10:39:23 am: Khemarint Son: Feel free to disprove me

20/06/2014 10:40:58 am: Khemarint Son: *gun related death

20/06/2014 10:51:42 am: Terry So: Actually, let's end it. Lol

24/06/2014 12:38:57 pm: Paul Khum: True man... Yeah no offence to Steven, but I can see why they gave the job to him.

24/06/2014 12:40:07 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Let's just say it's not who they're looking for.

24/06/2014 12:40:41 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: He's not..

27/06/2014 6:53:48 pm: Marra Lim: Yeah, tox free pays a lower base wage. But at the end of the week & end of financial year you make heaps more than tnt due to the overtime and weekend work

27/06/2014 6:54:24 pm: Paul Khum: So really your working for those extra dollars.

27/06/2014 6:55:05 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: U gotta start thinking about work life balance

27/06/2014 6:56:57 pm: Marra Lim: The loading is the hardest part of the day, which really isn't that hard.

27/06/2014 6:57:46 pm: Marra Lim: But once your on the road, time flys cos you just think about the work. And listening to the radio gets you through the day

29/06/2014 4:45:05 pm: Khemarint Son: 256 gig

29/06/2014 4:45:10 pm: Khemarint Son: Was the best price around

29/06/2014 4:45:35 pm: Khemarint Son: Makes boot ups for everything a lot faster

29/06/2014 4:45:42 pm: Khemarint Son: My old one struggled

29/06/2014 4:45:57 pm: Khemarint Son: My systems about 7 years old ish?

29/06/2014 5:19:38 pm: Paul Khum: Ye I'm looking at it now Lol

29/06/2014 5:23:47 pm: Paul Khum: Still not as cheap as that still

29/06/2014 5:24:23 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: I thought mine was a decent price

29/06/2014 5:27:07 pm: Khemarint Son: Had to go check

29/06/2014 5:27:20 pm: Khemarint Son: Got it ages back when ssd came onto the scene

29/06/2014 5:29:57 pm: Paul Khum: Ye that's still decent pricing. The cheapest I'm looking at msy is $85

29/06/2014 5:38:14 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: U can just get a small one.
Enough for ur OS to run

29/06/2014 5:38:43 pm: Paul Khum: Actually a 3.5 inch ssd is cheap!

29/06/2014 5:39:24 pm: Paul Khum: $140 for 2tb

29/06/2014 5:39:41 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Cheap!!

29/06/2014 5:45:45 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah the 2.5 inch  are expensive

29/06/2014 6:14:05 pm: Khemarint Son: I thought  ssd all same size

29/06/2014 6:14:16 pm: Khemarint Son: Mines a 2.5 in a 3.5 box

29/06/2014 6:14:33 pm: Khemarint Son: Or tray tuing

29/06/2014 6:14:37 pm: Khemarint Son: Thing*

29/06/2014 6:19:12 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Actually
Yeh don't think that's an ssd Paul

29/06/2014 6:19:56 pm: Terry So: Think that's a normal hdd

29/06/2014 6:20:25 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: that's just a normal sata drive

29/06/2014 6:21:23 pm: Khemarint Son: Ya no way that would be an ssd

29/06/2014 6:22:08 pm: Terry So: Ssds don't heat up. So good. And work so many times faster.

29/06/2014 6:27:22 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Msy sells the same one I bought

29/06/2014 6:27:34 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Only $55 more

29/06/2014 6:42:00 pm: Paul Khum: Ye what's on the msy Page pon.

29/06/2014 6:42:15 pm: Paul Khum: In the 3.5 inch hhd

29/06/2014 6:42:20 pm: Paul Khum: Seagate SSHD 1TB / 2TB / 4TB // Seagate SV35 2TB / 3TB 98/139/242 // 114

29/06/2014 6:45:14 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Just having a look.

Solid state hybrid drive..
Not sure what the diff is compared to the actual ssd

29/06/2014 6:47:47 pm: Paul Khum: Hmm Ye your one is still pretty cheap

29/06/2014 6:49:19 pm: Terry So: Hybrid... I remember them having a pretty good system

29/06/2014 6:49:20 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: So it uses both technology of ssd and hdd

29/06/2014 6:50:05 pm: Terry So: It stores small files on the hdd and big processing files on the ssd or something

29/06/2014 6:50:09 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: So I guess it's pretty good
$140 for 2tb

29/06/2014 6:53:40 pm: Paul Khum: Hmm what faster you reckon?

29/06/2014 6:53:47 pm: Paul Khum: The 2.5?

29/06/2014 6:54:14 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Ssd is the fastest
But it says sshd is close..

29/06/2014 6:54:17 pm: Khemarint Son: It's not about the size

29/06/2014 6:54:27 pm: Khemarint Son: It's the type of hard drive

29/06/2014 6:54:31 pm: Terry So: That's just size

29/06/2014 7:42:22 pm: Paul Khum: Ye solid state drive, I got mixed up with the hybrid drive on msy

29/06/2014 9:11:50 pm: Terry So: The purpose of the SSD in a hybrid drive is to act as a cache for the data stored on the HDD, by keeping copies of the most frequently used data on the SSD for improved overall performance.

29/06/2014 9:11:55 pm: Terry So: From wiki

2/07/2014 1:21:02 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Job interview.
When and how do U ask and negotiate salary

2/07/2014 1:29:12 pm: Paul Khum: In my experience you never really have room to negotiate the salary.
Before even going to the interview you would know / have a idea of the salary they are offering.

2/07/2014 1:30:06 pm: Paul Khum: They might ask the question... "So what's your salary expectation....?"
And you'll say... $xx amount

2/07/2014 1:31:23 pm: Paul Khum: That's my experience anyway.
You can of course ask what salary they are offering... But I've never had room to negotiate during the interview / meeting.

2/07/2014 1:33:27 pm: Khemarint Son: Rule of thumb. U shouldn't discuss salary in the interview

2/07/2014 1:33:32 pm: Khemarint Son: Unless they ask

2/07/2014 1:33:44 pm: Khemarint Son: But if they come out with an offer u can negotiate at that time

2/07/2014 2:24:05 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Hmm
I haven't got a clue what salary they're offering.
So if I wanted to find out, I shouldn't ask in the interview?

2/07/2014 2:29:26 pm: Paul Khum: How do you know about the job? Normally of your referred by someone they will know how much the company is offering

2/07/2014 2:31:10 pm: Paul Khum: E . G. When I referred Steven for the job. I asked how much they were offering for Steven. So he knew before going into the interview

2/07/2014 3:04:02 pm: Khemarint Son: Isit through a recruiter?

2/07/2014 3:04:07 pm: Khemarint Son: Or direct

2/07/2014 3:24:30 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Nah it is a referral, direct

So I'll prob ask them

7/07/2014 7:59:16 am: Ponnorraks Ou: My thoughts ..
Guilty, and one good reason why u shouldn't have a gun In a house

7/07/2014 8:00:01 am: Paul Khum: Lol man don't let one retard put you off responsible gun ownership

7/07/2014 8:00:38 am: Paul Khum: Plus according to gun laws here in Australia. Your not allowed to have a loaded gun in the house.

7/07/2014 8:00:47 am: Khemarint Son: This isn't how Guns are used in Australia

7/07/2014 8:00:50 am: Ponnorraks Ou: I never wanted ownership of one.

Just saying

7/07/2014 8:01:00 am: Khemarint Son: It's a bad idea for this very rrespmn

7/07/2014 8:01:23 am: Paul Khum: The gun needs to be kept in a safe. The magazine are also to be kept empty and in a diffent compartment in the safe.

7/07/2014 8:01:53 am: Paul Khum: Ammunition is also to be kept in a separated compartment in the safe.

7/07/2014 8:02:25 am: Paul Khum: In Australia, if this was to happen. You don't have time to go to the safe... And get the gun. Your really better off going to the kitchen  and getting g a knife.

18/07/2014 7:17:01 am: Khemarint Son: http://mobile.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/malaysia-airlines-plane-with-295-people-on-board-shot-down-on-russianukraine-border/story-fnizu68q-1226992872367

18/07/2014 7:35:01 am: Ponnorraks Ou: That's fuked

18/07/2014 7:48:49 am: Marra Lim: Yeh that's messed up. I'm curious to know if the pilot was in their air space or not.

18/07/2014 7:49:05 am: Marra Lim: Donetsk region. Where ever that is

18/07/2014 7:49:24 am: Ponnorraks Ou: There was a map at the end

18/07/2014 7:56:17 am: Khemarint Son: Since commercial carrier

18/07/2014 7:58:49 am: Paul Khum: Hmm in thinking that it might of, because the article said Malaysian airlines lost contact with the plane?

18/07/2014 8:00:00 am: Paul Khum: Malaysia Airlines said it had “lost contact” with flight MH17, 30km from the Tamak waypoint, 50km from the Russian-Ukraine border after 12am. The plane came down near the town of Shaktarsk, in the Donetsk region.

18/07/2014 8:00:37 am: Khemarint Son: Could that have been the result of the shot tho

18/07/2014 8:05:47 am: Ponnorraks Ou: A DUTCH man believed to be a passenger on the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 posted an image of the plane on his Facebook page before the fateful flight.

What seems to be a sarcastic post is now a tragic premonition of what was to come.

“This is what it looks like in case it goes down”, Cor Pan wrote on Facebook, presumably before he boarded.

18/07/2014 8:06:38 am: Paul Khum: Man not a good year for Malaysian airlines

18/07/2014 8:09:12 am: Khemarint Son: Ya terrible

18/07/2014 12:53:54 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Yeh I'll be at home as well

18/07/2014 2:06:36 pm: Paul Khum: Man all these news reports blaming the Russians. We all know it was the USA who did this. So they could invade eastern Ukraine

18/07/2014 2:07:17 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Is this another one of ur debates..

18/07/2014 2:09:48 pm: Paul Khum: Nah just the truth cuz. The USA wants the EU to boycott Russia's gas importation.
It's been happening for ages now.

18/07/2014 2:11:41 pm: Paul Khum: So Russia's economy relies heavily on natural resources.. One of these resources is natural gas. Which it exports to the EU via eastern Ukraine.

18/07/2014 2:12:32 pm: Khemarint Son: If there was a Russian guy who made a video of himself shooting the plane down and taking full. Blame for. The incident Paul will still. Blame USA

18/07/2014 2:12:33 pm: Khemarint Son: Hahaha

18/07/2014 2:12:54 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Yes agree with Khem

18/07/2014 2:16:54 pm: Khemarint Son: This particular incident I got no idea about

18/07/2014 2:17:03 pm: Khemarint Son: Still want to hear more

18/07/2014 2:18:05 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah shot down in eastern Ukraine, from supposedly "pro Russian insurgents" with a Russian missile

18/07/2014 2:25:55 pm: Paul Khum: Well your gonna be told that it's all Russia's fault, and the EU need a to step in do something about putin. Which is fucked cause the USA started all this.

18/07/2014 2:32:23 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Your information is definately interesting , but there is no evidence to say that what you're saying is the 'truth'

18/07/2014 2:52:18 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah you kinda  need to be following what's been happening for the last 12 to 18 months in the Ukraine.

18/07/2014 2:54:43 pm: Paul Khum: And it's all lead up to this...
The world bank offered Ukraine a loan, the Ukraine rejected this and went with a loan from Russia, in return Russia will be allowed to build a gas pipeline from Russia to the export to Europe.

18/07/2014 2:56:23 pm: Paul Khum: The the USA / world bank funded a left wing group to over throw the Ukraine government. This is now when Russia stepped into eastern Ukraine at the start of the year to defend its assets.

18/07/2014 2:59:19 pm: Paul Khum: The western media will say the Russians are 'terrorist/rebels ' but the Russians there will see themselves as freedom fighters, there in Crimea (eastern Ukraine) to protect is assets and Russian civilians

18/07/2014 3:00:57 pm: Paul Khum: I know, it's a lot to take in. It's pretty interesting man.

18/07/2014 3:05:43 pm: Paul Khum: I wish there was one Web Page that would summarise it all for ya...
I just feel it's key duty to tell you guys......

21/07/2014 9:42:47 pm: Terry So: Yes Paul, it does that. It also gives the government data in order to improve the system where it's needed. It also makes it convenient for people to get around without having to carry change all the time.

21/07/2014 10:18:04 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah then they want us to become a cashless society, that's when they'll in force the microchip in.

25/07/2014 8:51:17 am: Khemarint Son: Cutting

25/07/2014 8:51:25 am: Khemarint Son: I've taken one out and it took about 2 hours

25/07/2014 8:51:40 am: Khemarint Son: Plus it's close to the nerve so they gotta be careful. Too

25/07/2014 8:59:09 am: Paul Khum: Yeah sometimes the wisdom teeth is still under the gum. Well mine were

25/07/2014 10:11:32 am: Ponnorraks Ou: How did u kno u had to get them out?
Dentist and xray?
I'm  trying toget Anna to get an X-ray

25/07/2014 10:17:07 am: Paul Khum: Both dentist (orthodontist)  and xray

25/07/2014 10:19:21 am: Paul Khum: When I got my braces. They did a xray to see what the setup was.
I had 4 wisdom teeth, all under the gum. And all slanted side ways... So they would push against my teeth, rather than coming out vertically.
So the orthodontist said...
You have a few options, you can just take the 4 teeth out that you need to do for your braces, and leave the 4 wisdom teeth till later.
Or get all 8 done in one hit.

25/07/2014 10:19:57 am: Ponnorraks Ou: U did all 8?

25/07/2014 10:20:05 am: Paul Khum: I didn't want to deal with having to take more teeth out later on

25/07/2014 10:20:46 am: Paul Khum: Yep I did all 8 in one hit bro. Cost me abit more of course, but worth it I think

25/07/2014 10:21:06 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Yeh good choice

25/07/2014 10:21:17 am: Paul Khum: Like sooner or later the wisdom teeth will push, and it would probably Fuck up my teeth, that I just fixed

25/07/2014 10:21:36 am: Paul Khum: Yeah cost me 4k for the 8 extractions. But so worth it man. I felt nothing

25/07/2014 10:21:39 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Wonder how they dealt with wisdom teeths back in the 'Angkorian period'

25/07/2014 10:22:03 am: Terry So: Just man it up lol

25/07/2014 10:22:01 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Yeh that's bout right

25/07/2014 10:25:05 am: Paul Khum: And risk the wisdom teeth cramping up my teeth... Had bad teeth my whole life Lol

25/07/2014 10:25:53 am: Paul Khum: I had stitches all over my gums man... Had to be careful when brushing...

25/07/2014 10:27:25 am: Paul Khum: Terry, did you have to take any teeth out for your braces?

They say it's to block stolen phones, but really its going to be used for more malicious purposes.

14/08/2014 3:07:35 pm: Khemarint Son: Isn't there already imei  block ability

14/08/2014 3:07:59 pm: Paul Khum: Yep exactly cuz! The technology is already there

14/08/2014 3:09:13 pm: Paul Khum: What this will allow is yo block phone usage within a certain area.
Say you wanted to stop anyone using  their phone within Fairfield. This kill switch will make it easier to do.

14/08/2014 3:09:38 pm: Paul Khum: Apparently, some of the new digital cameras are  also coming out with  kill switches and gps.

14/08/2014 3:10:21 pm: Paul Khum: So say they didn't want anyone to use their camera within a area, they could kill the device easy and stop anyone from taking a photo.

14/08/2014 3:12:03 pm: Paul Khum: You guys might be thinking, well Paul. Why would a California law affect me?
Well son, California is one of the biggest mobile market in the world. This will force all manufacturers to put these "kill switches in" from iPhone to HTC /Samsung.

14/08/2014 3:14:43 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: No.. I'm thinking how will this affect u/us?

Why would they block a certain area from making calls.. How do u come up with these thing?

14/08/2014 3:22:34 pm: Paul Khum: They could use a variety of reasons / excuses to use it.
Stop certain groups from communicating with each other. Like Islamic protesters recently in Lakemba.
Or trying to stop a fugitive on the run that theyre following.

14/08/2014 3:24:24 pm: Paul Khum: Recently the USA has had riots in St Louis.
Over a black man getting shot by a police.
If they had this technology they would of shut down everyone's phones within the area.

14/08/2014 3:24:41 pm: Khemarint Son: Good points

14/08/2014 3:24:54 pm: Khemarint Son: I'm. More of a conservative on these issues

14/08/2014 3:25:08 pm: Khemarint Son: I don't think the aus government has overstepped on a whole. Lot. Of issues

14/08/2014 3:25:09 pm: Paul Khum: Soon they'll be able to shut down certain functions of your phone. Like camera use, etc

14/08/2014 3:25:27 pm: Khemarint Son: Maybe the whole torrenting thing

14/08/2014 3:26:30 pm: Paul Khum: Nah aus government is alright. Even though they are spying on its citizens (us) and sharing the info with the other 4 counties (USA, Canada, UK and new Zealand)

14/08/2014 3:28:03 pm: Khemarint Son: Tbh I'm. Not to fussed with spying on citizens

14/08/2014 3:28:34 pm: Khemarint Son: I don't feel that it'd a huge deal for me

14/08/2014 3:29:01 pm: Khemarint Son: Again maybe because I feel aus gov isn't to bad (assuming u ain't a muslim)

14/08/2014 3:30:54 pm: Paul Khum: Lol Muslims have it hard right now. And the situation in Iraq isn't helping them either.

14/08/2014 3:31:19 pm: Paul Khum: I'm not too fussed on it either.
I just be like no privacy = no freedom.

14/08/2014 3:31:42 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Actually.. Yeh I think 99% of Paul's concerns so far.. Doesn't affect me in any way, at the moment. If they're going to happen, they're going to happen so just deal with it

14/08/2014 3:35:17 pm: Paul Khum: It won't concern you until it affects you and by the time then it will be too late.

14/08/2014 3:36:00 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: That's true.
But I'll have ppl like urself fighting for us in the meantime

14/08/2014 3:40:19 pm: Paul Khum: I just believe people have the right to privacy and freedom.
You can tap someone's phone, and hack there computer. But I like to believe you need probable cause and a warrant to do this.
Or else what's stopping people from abusing this power.

14/08/2014 3:40:19 pm: Terry So: Go Paul! Take on the US government for our future.

14/08/2014 3:45:27 pm: Paul Khum: I'd take on any one who gets in the way of my freedom / civil liberties.

14/08/2014 3:46:11 pm: Paul Khum: One person can't do much, but a group people can.

14/08/2014 3:46:52 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: I agree with u on that point.

But Misuse of power is happening today and has been since forever.

Yes.. A group of ppl can. But Again I have Better things to do

14/08/2014 3:47:48 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Don't worry... I believe soon.. Soon you'll have a concern where I will jump onboard with!

14/08/2014 3:55:57 pm: Paul Khum: Yea  it's about exposing the miss use of power.
It's never going to be prefect but we can at least hope to stop another pol pot from happening.

14/08/2014 4:01:38 pm: Paul Khum: Did you go on a protest before pon? About something in Cambodia?

14/08/2014 4:45:13 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Nope

14/08/2014 4:48:33 pm: Paul Khum: Oh okay, I thought you went on a protest before in the city. About something for Cambodia.

Rafiki: it doesn't matter, it's in the past.

Simba: yeah, but it still hurts.

Rafiki: oh yes; the past can hurt but from the way I see it, you can either run from it or... Learn from it.

Rafiki swings hit stick at simba while simba dodges.

Rafiki: ha! You see? So what are you going to do?

11/09/2014 11:39:56 am: Marra Lim: No, they do it in bulk (pallets) through a different division. I would imagine it would be pretty scary to carry that.

6/01/2015 11:26:16 pm: Marra Lim: Try it, 60 a day for 2 weeks straight. Proper technique though. It can be 3 sets of 20 if you like.

6/01/2015 11:26:33 pm: Paul Khum: *shake

6/01/2015 11:26:59 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Does alright with ice too?

6/01/2015 11:29:02 pm: Marra Lim: There Is still an element of cardio in sit-ups.

6/01/2015 11:30:22 pm: Paul Khum: Got a be the diet

6/01/2015 11:31:27 pm: Paul Khum: You pack lunch? Or buy?

6/01/2015 11:32:05 pm: Marra Lim: Always pack lunch. But end up buying as well when I know I have to stay back later for work.

6/01/2015 11:32:49 pm: Marra Lim: I eat rice everyday. Bread. I'm addicted to carbs.

6/01/2015 11:33:08 pm: Marra Lim: If you want to lose fat, stop the carbs.

6/01/2015 11:34:05 pm: Paul Khum: I'm a desk jockey

6/01/2015 11:34:07 pm: Marra Lim: You'll lose fat quick. But then if your depriving yourself, and your lacking energy. Then it's only a short term fix.

7/01/2015 6:41:39 am: Khemarint Son: Marra thst won't get u a 6pck  I can guarantee it

7/01/2015 6:41:50 am: Khemarint Son: 6 pack is about body fat

7/01/2015 6:42:09 am: Khemarint Son: Sit ups won't make u lose fat

7/01/2015 6:44:50 am: Khemarint Son: If your fat there's absolutely. No way u can  get a 6 pack without drugs

7/01/2015 6:45:59 am: Marra Lim: Your right. The sit-ups will give you the definition though. Underneath the flab you got to get rid of.

7/01/2015 6:46:24 am: Khemarint Son: But then 60 day sit ups wouldn't achieve thst for the majority of people

7/01/2015 6:46:40 am: Marra Lim: Drugs help. I got nothing against it. Just not highly spoken about. Probably cos it's frowned upon .

7/01/2015 6:46:49 am: Khemarint Son: Haha

7/01/2015 6:47:10 am: Khemarint Son: Let's all hit Pep tides up

7/01/2015 6:49:48 am: Marra Lim: Unfortunately for him he got busted. Not sure how though

7/01/2015 7:27:41 am: Khemarint Son: Basically anything positive in an athletic environment u can think of

7/01/2015 7:34:32 am: Marra Lim: Side effects can't be that bad, heaps of people are on it.

7/01/2015 12:27:29 pm: Paul Khum: There's a sign there that says it. 4pm  to 7pm

7/01/2015 12:27:35 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: They waived that on annas one

7/01/2015 12:27:38 pm: Paul Khum: You need to pay $5

7/01/2015 12:27:49 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: So I asked for the same If I resign up

7/01/2015 12:28:33 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: She goes.. it doesn't say on the system.

I told them they wrote it on the contract

7/01/2015 12:28:52 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah they changed it man

7/01/2015 12:28:57 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Yeh that's true we're never in b4 7.. But just nice to have

7/01/2015 12:29:12 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah would be heaps good

7/01/2015 12:39:34 pm: Terry So: Cambodia is 31%

7/01/2015 12:39:42 pm: Terry So: Kids under 14

7/01/2015 12:39:53 pm: Khemarint Son: What does the stat reflect

7/01/2015 12:39:58 pm: Khemarint Son: Isit higher death rate

7/01/2015 12:40:30 pm: Terry So: I don't think it's higher death rates.

7/01/2015 12:40:39 pm: Terry So: It is linked though

7/01/2015 12:40:56 pm: Khemarint Son: Interesting  stat

7/01/2015 12:40:58 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: I'd say Cambodia needs a high percentage of under 20s

7/01/2015 12:41:00 pm: Khemarint Son: What about Japan

7/01/2015 12:41:06 pm: Khemarint Son: I heard they have an aging population

7/01/2015 12:41:14 pm: Terry So: But I was thinking more life expectency is lower

7/01/2015 12:41:20 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Need these under 20s to get educated and help the country

7/01/2015 12:41:29 pm: Terry So: Japan13%

7/01/2015 12:41:49 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah but Cambodia doesn't have that old knowledge base

7/01/2015 12:42:01 pm: Paul Khum: High population of young dumb cunts

7/01/2015 12:45:17 pm: Terry So: To me, it reflects life expectancy. Hard for a country to progress when they're all fighting for their lives.

7/01/2015 12:46:11 pm: Paul Khum: Cambodia had a genocide, so most of the aging population was wiped out

7/01/2015 12:47:16 pm: Khemarint Son: True

7/01/2015 12:47:29 pm: Khemarint Son: Wonder what Japan is

7/01/2015 12:47:33 pm: Khemarint Son: U got that stat terry

7/01/2015 12:56:40 pm: Steven Lim: Japan is like 20-25% under 18with 30% over 60

7/01/2015 1:03:10 pm: Terry So: Wow, does that mean 30% are retired?

7/01/2015 1:04:54 pm: Steven Lim: Not sure probably different over thete

7/01/2015 10:51:26 pm: Paul Khum: I reckon terry could do it

7/01/2015 10:51:48 pm: Paul Khum: Me on the other hand.... 😢

7/01/2015 10:52:51 pm: Marra Lim: If you can't commit to 14 days, try 3 days. Tell me how you feel then.

7/01/2015 10:53:34 pm: Paul Khum: Nah I'll commit

Portion control. Eat less more often

19/01/2015 6:42:23 pm: Marra Lim: You'll find when you work out you become more hungry naturally. That's normal, so eat. If your hungry, eat.

6/05/2015 8:15:43 am: Paul Khum: How come you need new suspension? Is that because it was lowered?

6/05/2015 8:21:44 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Your type R sus feels as good as the day it was new .

6/05/2015 8:22:15 am: Ponnorraks Ou: It's made to ride harsh

Sportivo sus is exactly the same as what they put in my dads Corolla ..

6/05/2015 8:22:29 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Speaking of that. He just smashed it yesterday

6/05/2015 8:23:36 am: Paul Khum: Huh! Smashed it!? He's not injured is he?

6/05/2015 8:28:00 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Nah he's good.

6/05/2015 10:52:23 am: Paul Khum: Hmm I don't know about her

6/05/2015 10:55:54 am: Khemarint Son: Potentialy be a fatty

6/05/2015 10:57:51 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Haha

6/05/2015 10:58:16 am: Ponnorraks Ou: I picture that as Terry's type.
Looks like a halfie. Sorta cute face

6/05/2015 11:53:12 am: Paul Khum: Terry, your thoughts? Don't be shy. All family here.

6/05/2015 12:22:41 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: This is why terry barely goes over his 2gb data

6/05/2015 2:15:31 pm: Paul Khum: Hmm wonder where he is? Must be real busy.

6/05/2015 2:15:44 pm: Paul Khum: My data usage has gone up more since catching the train

6/05/2015 5:31:00 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Yeh u would use more.

7/05/2015 3:07:27 pm: Terry So: If I parked on the streets of Fairfield, I'd say it could happen there too

7/05/2015 3:07:56 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Fuk man

7/05/2015 3:07:57 pm: Terry So: Yeah, they're kids. They get a thrill out of it.

7/05/2015 3:11:35 pm: Terry So: Happens everywhere. Sucks that it happens. Just glad damage was minimal. Two small cuts, three small bruises.

7/05/2015 3:11:56 pm: Khemarint Son: Thing about yennora is thst there's not many people

7/05/2015 3:12:13 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Go boxing classes with Khem

7/05/2015 3:12:16 pm: Terry So: Oh, there were people. They just don't do anything.

7/05/2015 3:12:22 pm: Khemarint Son: Even at 10 pm there's quite a few people at Fairfield s

7/05/2015 3:12:27 pm: Terry So: I don't think they even noticed what was happening

7/05/2015 3:12:48 pm: Khemarint Son: True most the time no1 will

7/05/2015 3:12:57 pm: Khemarint Son: I prob won't either

7/05/2015 3:13:00 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Glad you're alright tho

7/05/2015 3:13:01 pm: Khemarint Son: If I was solo

7/05/2015 3:13:16 pm: Terry So: My mate got robbed, knife and glass, on parra road in peak hour.

7/05/2015 3:13:55 pm: Paul Khum: Wtf terry! 😥

7/05/2015 3:15:05 pm: Paul Khum: Just for a phone! Fucken hell

7/05/2015 3:15:06 pm: Terry So: If it's not 5v1, it'll be weapons.

7/05/2015 3:15:26 pm: Paul Khum: Still, I hate this shit

7/05/2015 3:15:36 pm: Paul Khum: Your car is close to the station too!

7/05/2015 3:15:57 pm: Paul Khum: It's dark by 6pm these day I leave work at 540 and it's dark

7/05/2015 3:16:31 pm: Khemarint Son: Ya it sucks

7/05/2015 3:16:36 pm: Terry So: More concerned if others get stacked.

7/05/2015 3:16:37 pm: Khemarint Son: Not much u can do really against 5

7/05/2015 3:16:47 pm: Khemarint Son: U still gonna Park there?

7/05/2015 3:16:58 pm: Paul Khum: Fucken lebs

7/05/2015 3:17:00 pm: Khemarint Son: My only suggestion if u are,  maybe don't talk on fone till ur in your car

7/05/2015 3:17:02 pm: Terry So: Hmm, I want to but my dad will get pissed. Might have to go canley

7/05/2015 3:17:16 pm: Khemarint Son: Least u can be more vigilant

7/05/2015 3:17:23 pm: Paul Khum: Did they know what car you had?

7/05/2015 3:17:45 pm: Terry So: Yeah,  I'll start being more aware of my surroundings oppose to looking at my phone

7/05/2015 3:17:45 pm: Paul Khum: Ye that's a good suggestion khem

7/05/2015 3:18:01 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah your normally quite care free

7/05/2015 3:18:04 pm: Terry So: Yeah, they ran off and threw my keys back.

7/05/2015 3:18:30 pm: Terry So: Still am. Don't want an incident like this change my perception.

7/05/2015 3:18:46 pm: Paul Khum: So what they went through your bag while your on the floor?

7/05/2015 3:18:53 pm: Paul Khum: Fuck this burns me man

7/05/2015 3:19:17 pm: Paul Khum: First thing,  get a new hair cut (seriously)

7/05/2015 3:19:42 pm: Paul Khum: I don't want them noticing you again and taking advantage of you again

7/05/2015 3:19:43 pm: Terry So: Nah, they ran off with my wallet phone and bag. After I went to the police, I went back, saw my bag on the ground elsewhere. Had my watch and... Not much else in there

7/05/2015 3:20:00 pm: Terry So: A haircut? lol

7/05/2015 3:20:16 pm: Terry So: I just got one

7/05/2015 3:20:21 pm: Terry So: On the weekend

7/05/2015 3:20:27 pm: Paul Khum: Lol fuck! Change it again!

7/05/2015 3:20:31 pm: Paul Khum: Shave it!

7/05/2015 3:21:04 pm: Terry So: I told you, I don't want the incident to change me.

7/05/2015 3:21:39 pm: Terry So: Learn from it, be more aware. But not change how I see people

7/05/2015 3:21:47 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah I know, you live yenora. You've been selling it to us for ages.

7/05/2015 3:21:51 pm: Paul Khum: *love

7/05/2015 3:22:21 pm: Terry So: I might park in canley though. Just so my dad feels a bit more at ease

7/05/2015 3:22:42 pm: Terry So: Gonna have to start looking for carpark now

7/05/2015 3:24:09 pm: Paul Khum: Well that's already changed you abit. But yeah unfortunately think you need to be abit more vigilant.

7/05/2015 3:24:23 pm: Paul Khum: Like man how far were you from the station?

7/05/2015 3:24:37 pm: Paul Khum: Did you past the bend / turn?

7/05/2015 3:31:46 pm: Terry So: Yeah, just past the bend.

7/05/2015 3:32:31 pm: Paul Khum: Hmm I was kinda hoping it was in range of the cameras

7/05/2015 3:33:10 pm: Terry So: There are cameras around the area for the factories. Hopefully not dud cameras

7/05/2015 3:33:13 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: If they're dumb enough to get there or get away by train

7/05/2015 3:33:24 pm: Terry So: <image omitted>

7/05/2015 3:33:38 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Should be easy to see 5 guys on camera

7/05/2015 3:34:04 pm: Terry So: Yeah lol I'm sure they ran past infrared cameras too. But again, could be dud

7/05/2015 3:34:05 pm: Paul Khum: I'd say they would of gotten away by train, if they were kids.

7/05/2015 3:35:35 pm: Paul Khum: Fuck, just so happens to be a halal store there. Fucken lebs

7/05/2015 3:40:14 pm: Paul Khum: I'm just abit suprised if people saw you getting kicked on the ground and they didn't do anything. One would think they would assist in some way, or that the guys wouldn't have the guts to do anything.

7/05/2015 3:48:17 pm: Khemarint Son: I'm not surprised

7/05/2015 3:48:23 pm: Khemarint Son: I've seen  people getting bashed before

7/05/2015 3:48:40 pm: Khemarint Son: U don't do anything because ur scared u can get bashed too

7/05/2015 3:50:35 pm: Terry So: I was discussing it with my friend and he said his mum saw the car in front of her, stop in the middle of the road, and bash someone. She was just in shock and didn't even think to notice the number plate

7/05/2015 3:59:41 pm: Paul Khum: Hmm that sucks, you'd hope people would help or something. Like people fighting among themselves is one thing, but seeing someone get jumped by 5 guys. Fuck I don't know aye.

7/05/2015 4:02:17 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Yeh u don't know how
It started

Unless u have ppl in the crowd to help back u up. Best thing u can do is call for help

7/05/2015 4:02:36 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah that's what I'm thinking, yell really loud or something?

7/05/2015 4:02:52 pm: Paul Khum: Cause a scene

7/05/2015 4:05:32 pm: Terry So: Hmm, I forgot to scream

7/05/2015 4:05:40 pm: Terry So: Just not my first instinct

7/05/2015 4:07:00 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah you may have gone shock and went silent.

7/05/2015 4:07:34 pm: Paul Khum: Do you mind me asking how it started? Like did they start by saying "give us your phone?" or did they just start hitting ya?

7/05/2015 4:25:28 pm: Terry So: I saw a bunch of guys hanging out. Looked like they were going back to my car. When I got to my car, the ran towards me, one hit me, I tried to run, got surrounded, crouched and covered my face, they started kicking me on the floor, couldn't escape, threw my phone wallet keys and bag off, they ran off and threw my keys back

7/05/2015 4:26:23 pm: Paul Khum: That's fucked man

7/05/2015 4:27:06 pm: Paul Khum: So they would know that the falcon is your car then?

7/05/2015 4:29:53 pm: Terry So: Yeah

7/05/2015 4:30:13 pm: Paul Khum: Dam, ye really can't Park there anymore man 😔

7/05/2015 4:30:57 pm: Paul Khum: I thought on the slight chance they didn't know it was your car, and may be you could Park there later on if you wanted to.

7/05/2015 4:31:18 pm: Terry So: I still think any place is the same. Maybe I'll go rsl in ffld since I catch the train after nine.

7/05/2015 4:31:21 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Do u have find my phone or find my MacBook on?

7/05/2015 4:31:32 pm: Terry So: Nah

7/05/2015 4:33:23 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah these things can happen anywhere, from city to North Shore. But yenora is pretty empty most of the times, I guess that's why you liked parking there.

7/05/2015 4:34:18 pm: Khemarint Son: I don't think it's the same

7/05/2015 4:34:23 pm: Khemarint Son: True it can happen anywhere

7/05/2015 4:34:30 pm: Khemarint Son: But I reakon some places have more risk

7/05/2015 4:34:40 pm: Paul Khum: Ye agreed man

7/05/2015 4:34:44 pm: Khemarint Son: I can't picture this happening at canley man

7/05/2015 4:34:55 pm: Paul Khum: Or fairfield?

7/05/2015 4:34:57 pm: Khemarint Son: But we all did say it didn't feel that safe last Friday!

7/05/2015 4:35:12 pm: Paul Khum: Ye I felt scared, and I was with you guys.

7/05/2015 4:35:43 pm: Khemarint Son: Thst sucks terry!

7/05/2015 4:35:52 pm: Khemarint Son: I'm Angry for u man

7/05/2015 4:36:05 pm: Khemarint Son: Havnt heard of stuff like this for a while

7/05/2015 4:36:21 pm: Terry So: Policeman said it happens everywhere. He seemed to criticise Guildford the most

7/05/2015 4:36:27 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah same, and to hear it to my cousin. I'm fucken pissed.

7/05/2015 4:36:48 pm: Paul Khum: Yeah guildford is fucked! Jen hates it.

7/05/2015 4:37:46 pm: Khemarint Son: Guildford and yennora look equally bad to Mr

7/05/2015 4:37:55 pm: Khemarint Son: Yennora to Auburn is Leb ville

7/05/2015 4:37:58 pm: Paul Khum: Yep and Warwick farm

7/05/2015 4:37:59 pm: Terry So: Don't worry, boss was nice, gave me two days off. Didn't scar me that much. More concerned if it happens again to other people

7/05/2015 4:39:28 pm: Terry So: Was thinking of putting fliers on other people's cars

7/05/2015 4:40:15 pm: Paul Khum: Cuz your too nice man. I'd fucken try and find the cunts and seek justice. Talk to the businesses around there check out their cameras.

7/05/2015 4:40:31 pm: Paul Khum: Ask city rail staff of the cameras at the time.

7/05/2015 4:40:49 pm: Terry So: I think I might leave that to the police. I'm not pro in crime

7/05/2015 4:41:02 pm: Paul Khum: I'm telling ya now they won't do shit

7/05/2015 4:41:43 pm: Paul Khum: Well not proactively anyway

7/05/2015 4:43:10 pm: Terry So: Don't think you can say that. I don't know what an accountant does. Don't think you know what a policeman does.

7/05/2015 4:44:31 pm: Terry So: I had no idea what a retail worker did until I was in the field. You only really see what you see and think they do that for eight hours a day

7/05/2015 4:45:36 pm: Khemarint Son: They probsly won't find anyone

7/05/2015 4:45:46 pm: Khemarint Son: But u can't ask for that stuff anyway Paul

7/05/2015 4:45:52 pm: Khemarint Son: There not gona show you

7/05/2015 4:47:22 pm: Paul Khum: Ye I probably been watching too much law and order

7/05/2015 4:47:40 pm: Terry So: As a developer, there's maybe three things we do.
- write code
- figure out why the code doesn't work
- test your code

7/05/2015 4:48:03 pm: Khemarint Son: U don't get to look at their videos and go vigilante on some screen shot of their face to

7/05/2015 4:48:04 pm: Khemarint Son: Lol

7/05/2015 4:48:30 pm: Terry So: If I can't identify them, can't do much.

7/05/2015 4:48:41 pm: Paul Khum: Lol ye not the city rail photos but may be the business one

7/05/2015 4:48:49 pm: Terry So: Best way to trace them is to find the items stolen.

7/05/2015 4:48:51 pm: Paul Khum: Fuck too much law and order and gta

7/05/2015 4:49:54 pm: Paul Khum: All cops are there for is to bust you when you do something  wrong

7/05/2015 4:50:04 pm: Paul Khum: Most of them are a bunch of dumb cunts in my opinion

7/05/2015 4:50:05 pm: Khemarint Son: We need dexter

7/05/2015 4:50:06 pm: Khemarint Son: Hahaba

7/05/2015 4:50:20 pm: Steven Lim: man thats fked man i told all my friends to stay away from that area

7/05/2015 4:50:21 pm: Paul Khum: Until you get to detective level then they have some brains

7/05/2015 4:50:39 pm: Terry So: Lol, level up

7/05/2015 4:51:31 pm: Paul Khum: My mates have cop friends, there fucken dumb and lazy man. All they want to do is drive their car fast with the siren on. Can't shoot for shit either.

7/05/2015 4:51:46 pm: Paul Khum: Lol where is dexter when we need him

7/05/2015 4:52:05 pm: Terry So: Dexter wouldn't care. They're not serial killers

7/05/2015 4:52:39 pm: Paul Khum: Not yet theyre not 😡

7/05/2015 4:53:35 pm: Paul Khum: 5 on 1 for a phone and laptop, man What's the world coming to. Don't need to hit the guy, just treaten him first.

7/05/2015 4:53:56 pm: Paul Khum: Did you give the imei number / serial number to the cops?

7/05/2015 4:55:39 pm: Terry So: Yeah, already done. Not sure if they can do much if its not linked...

7/05/2015 4:56:10 pm: Paul Khum: If it gets sold to a pawn broker or something, they can trace who sold it.

7/05/2015 5:00:06 pm: Terry So: Yeah

7/05/2015 5:12:38 pm: Paul Khum: As long as your spirit hasn't been broken, then it's alright. I've been rolled twice growing up. Once by fobs, then by viets. Doesn't feel good at all.

7/05/2015 5:15:19 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: I've been alrite


But it's getting dark early now and I walk 1.3km to Redfern station

7/05/2015 5:16:34 pm: Khemarint Son: I been rolled twice I think

7/05/2015 5:16:41 pm: Khemarint Son: I saw one of the guys years later

7/05/2015 5:16:48 pm: Khemarint Son: He looked like a chump

7/05/2015 5:18:49 pm: Paul Khum: I think Redfern is okay now? West side is pretty bad, guess that's why people look down on it. And why car insurance cost so much more. I blame lebs.

7/05/2015 5:19:29 pm: Khemarint Son: Asians were the 90s nuisances

7/05/2015 5:26:57 pm: Paul Khum: Dam followed, but does anything happen? Like mugging? Or just sleazy guys being jerks?

7/05/2015 5:28:12 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Don't think so. Didn't get that far

But a lot of cases of ppl snatching / taking bags from passenger seat through windows or by opening the door whilst ppl are stopped at traffic lights

8/05/2015 8:24:54 am: Marra Lim: Yeah she thought it was real, I feel bad, and I decided not to drag it on and let her know

8/05/2015 8:26:00 am: Khemarint Son: A ring like thst if it were real

8/05/2015 8:26:08 am: Khemarint Son: I'd imagine would cost quite a bit

8/05/2015 8:29:57 am: Paul Khum: Lol don't think she would turn down a catch like musher 😎

8/05/2015 8:30:26 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Keep going with the story.. So involved with this fake ring I forgot to say congratulations

8/05/2015 8:30:39 am: Marra Lim: The way it happened. She was a sleep, I grabbed her hand and placed the ring on her finger under the blanket.. She then woke up. And was ecstatic

8/05/2015 8:32:31 am: Marra Lim: Initially, she was like why the fuck you grabbing my hand..

8/05/2015 8:32:41 am: Ponnorraks Ou: rape!

8/05/2015 8:33:04 am: Marra Lim: Then when the ring came on, she was bouncing around..

8/05/2015 8:33:27 am: Marra Lim: So it was a forced proposal. She didn't have a choice

8/05/2015 8:33:35 am: Khemarint Son: So did u ask

8/05/2015 8:33:49 am: Marra Lim: I though I try and get her when she wasn't conscious

8/05/2015 8:34:09 am: Marra Lim: Eventually .. Yes

8/05/2015 8:34:46 am: Marra Lim: She wore it to work the next day. I told her to take it off.. Not yet..

8/05/2015 8:35:25 am: Paul Khum: Dam good thing you told her

8/05/2015 8:35:29 am: Khemarint Son: Lol

8/05/2015 8:35:34 am: Khemarint Son: Fuck that would of been bad

8/05/2015 8:35:55 am: Ponnorraks Ou: So she ain't gonna wear one til you get the real one?

8/05/2015 8:36:08 am: Khemarint Son: The GST thing might be one of the most unromantic things I ever heard

8/05/2015 8:36:09 am: Khemarint Son: Hahaha

8/05/2015 8:36:19 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Yeh man

8/05/2015 8:36:20 am: Khemarint Son: Though practical

8/05/2015 8:36:30 am: Paul Khum: I think ye wait till you get the real one

8/05/2015 8:36:32 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Plus the embarrassment for her.

8/05/2015 8:36:33 am: Khemarint Son: Her friends are gona ask her where's ya ring!

8/05/2015 8:37:20 am: Marra Lim: She was happy to wear it, but I really don't want her to

8/05/2015 8:37:34 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Yeh so u get why

8/05/2015 8:37:44 am: Ponnorraks Ou: What were u thinking man

8/05/2015 8:42:19 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Obviously she wants to get engaged.

She obviously loves and wants the 'real' ring.

8/05/2015 8:42:28 am: Paul Khum: Oh yeah the girl wants the Hollywood style. Ring and proposal all in one

8/05/2015 8:43:12 am: Khemarint Son: Alot of my mates prefer fake ring

8/05/2015 8:43:19 am: Khemarint Son: So they get to choose their own ring

8/05/2015 8:43:21 am: Khemarint Son: Haha

8/05/2015 8:43:54 am: Paul Khum: Yeah but wouldn't it be better than she got something she liked? Rather than musher picking one for her?

8/05/2015 8:43:54 am: Paul Khum: Yeah I thought that's what most girls wanted these days

8/05/2015 8:44:19 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Yeh definitely Paul.

8/05/2015 8:44:29 am: Khemarint Son: I got bad taste

8/05/2015 8:44:36 am: Khemarint Son: I'm no norak ou

8/05/2015 8:45:10 am: Ponnorraks Ou: But that wasn't Marras motives

8/05/2015 8:45:50 am: Paul Khum: Yeah I thought that's what it was? Fake ring now, legit ring she can pick herself?

8/05/2015 8:46:25 am: Khemarint Son: Hahaha

8/05/2015 8:46:34 am: Khemarint Son: Now that u mention It pon

8/05/2015 8:46:40 am: Khemarint Son: We don't actually know if she gets to choose

8/05/2015 8:50:23 am: Ponnorraks Ou: What's your parents think?

8/05/2015 8:50:23 am: Khemarint Son: Wasn't sure if u were ready for commitment!,

8/05/2015 8:50:54 am: Paul Khum: I feel he was more forced into it from her

8/05/2015 8:51:14 am: Paul Khum: Given the 30 age dead line

8/05/2015 8:52:20 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Yeh true that


Anna's sister left her 7 years bf coz he never proposed

8/05/2015 8:52:37 am: Ponnorraks Ou: He told me he was planning that year too

8/05/2015 8:52:49 am: Paul Khum: Hmm I don't think that's fair

8/05/2015 8:52:56 am: Ponnorraks Ou: I don't either

8/05/2015 8:53:00 am: Paul Khum: Is she married yet?

8/05/2015 8:53:10 am: Ponnorraks Ou: If u love the guy it shouldn't matter

8/05/2015 8:53:23 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Nah she's not... Don't think she plans to

8/05/2015 8:53:28 am: Paul Khum: Man she cheated, with that guy 😔

8/05/2015 8:53:40 am: Paul Khum: Then that's fucked

8/05/2015 8:53:46 am: Paul Khum: I think that's more of a excuse, not a reason

8/05/2015 8:54:10 am: Ponnorraks Ou: She did actually want to

Married and have a kid

8/05/2015 8:54:20 am: Khemarint Son: I think it's fair from the girls prospective

8/05/2015 8:54:27 am: Khemarint Son: She doesn't know if the guy will ever propose

8/05/2015 8:54:35 am: Khemarint Son: I guess she can't wait around forever

8/05/2015 8:54:50 am: Khemarint Son: (I've got friends both on the girls side and guys side of thisn situation)

8/05/2015 8:54:54 am: Paul Khum: Why not if you love the guy?

8/05/2015 8:55:04 am: Khemarint Son: Because if he never proposes

8/05/2015 8:55:20 am: Khemarint Son: Then u waste thst time u could of invested in someone else

8/05/2015 8:55:34 am: Khemarint Son: Some guys just don't wanna get. Married

8/05/2015 8:55:40 am: Paul Khum: But your together in a relation with them already?

8/05/2015 8:55:54 am: Paul Khum: Ye fair enough

8/05/2015 8:56:04 am: Khemarint Son: She's looking for marriage

8/05/2015 8:56:14 am: Khemarint Son: She's pretty transparent about it

8/05/2015 8:56:32 am: Paul Khum: I felt she was already in a long term relationship, and they had that connection.

8/05/2015 8:56:34 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Man .. If u love it other it really shouldn't matter

8/05/2015 8:56:39 am: Khemarint Son: It's like if ur gf is a junky

8/05/2015 8:56:48 am: Khemarint Son: U tell her I don't want u doing this

8/05/2015 8:56:58 am: Ponnorraks Ou: But if she was just looking for an excuse to leave then diff story

8/05/2015 8:57:04 am: Paul Khum: Nah that's differnt man, that's comparing apple and oranges

8/05/2015 8:57:13 am: Khemarint Son: It's not in this case

8/05/2015 8:57:34 am: Khemarint Son: In my. Opinion it's something the girl wants from the relationship

8/05/2015 8:57:43 am: Khemarint Son: Same as if u want ur gf to stop being a junky

8/05/2015 8:57:45 am: Paul Khum: Your in a relationship, everything feels like a marriage already. May be the guy just isn't ready yet?

8/05/2015 8:58:01 am: Khemarint Son: That's only to you

8/05/2015 8:58:06 am: Khemarint Son: Other people don't feel like that

8/05/2015 8:58:39 am: Paul Khum: Well they're fucked, it's not really love then

8/05/2015 8:58:41 am: Khemarint Son: Most people I'd say feel marriage is diff level to dating

8/05/2015 8:58:58 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Same thing for me

8/05/2015 8:59:02 am: Paul Khum: You love them based on the certain conditions

8/05/2015 8:59:32 am: Paul Khum: Most people I talk to say it's the same. They still feel the same

8/05/2015 8:59:56 am: Paul Khum: I don't know anyone that I've spoken to said getting married changed their relationship

8/05/2015 9:00:26 am: Paul Khum: If your relationship is bad before getting married, I don't think getting married is going to make it better

8/05/2015 9:00:33 am: Khemarint Son: Well  I guess one argument is

8/05/2015 9:00:35 am: Khemarint Son: If it's the same

8/05/2015 9:00:39 am: Khemarint Son: Then why arnt u married?

8/05/2015 9:00:44 am: Khemarint Son: It's the same right?

8/05/2015 9:01:05 am: Ponnorraks Ou: It's more of a proper commitment to each other

8/05/2015 9:01:26 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Or as I said before the nx step I life

8/05/2015 9:02:00 am: Ponnorraks Ou: We're just following what Ppl have been doing for centuries and think it's the right thing to do?

8/05/2015 9:03:32 am: Paul Khum: Could be that he was saving for a house or nice ring for her?

8/05/2015 9:03:48 am: Paul Khum: Yeah to most people it really is the next step

8/05/2015 9:04:11 am: Ponnorraks Ou: That's right... Basically just not ready.

8/05/2015 9:04:37 am: Khemarint Son: From the girls perspective she   doesn't have to wait

8/05/2015 9:04:42 am: Paul Khum: You love the guy for who he is, I feel bad for him if he was going to propose that year

8/05/2015 9:04:46 am: Khemarint Son: He could of easily just not wanted to get married

8/05/2015 9:04:53 am: Khemarint Son: This was the case with my friends

8/05/2015 9:05:06 am: Khemarint Son: (girl had a young kid so guy wouldn't commit)

8/05/2015 9:05:34 am: Paul Khum: I think he might, just right now the maturity level is differnt with a girl and guy. Girls are generally more mature

8/05/2015 9:07:24 am: Paul Khum: So the girl with the kid left him?

8/05/2015 9:07:53 am: Khemarint Son: Yep

8/05/2015 9:08:01 am: Paul Khum: Dam

8/05/2015 9:08:02 am: Khemarint Son: And I don't disagree with her decision

8/05/2015 9:08:09 am: Khemarint Son: Coz it's hard for girls with kids

8/05/2015 9:08:14 am: Khemarint Son: Bad stigma

8/05/2015 9:08:15 am: Khemarint Son: Etc

8/05/2015 9:08:17 am: Paul Khum: Yeah man its baggage

8/05/2015 9:08:24 am: Khemarint Son: My. Parents would die

8/05/2015 9:08:30 am: Khemarint Son: If I married a single mum

8/05/2015 9:08:31 am: Paul Khum: Yeah same

8/05/2015 9:08:32 am: Khemarint Son: Lll

8/05/2015 9:08:37 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Yeh I kinda understand that one

8/05/2015 9:08:42 am: Paul Khum: Mum would go off at me

8/05/2015 9:08:45 am: Khemarint Son: "slut!"

8/05/2015 9:08:50 am: Paul Khum: Hahaha

8/05/2015 9:08:59 am: Paul Khum: "wtf! Taking care of someone else's kid!"

8/05/2015 9:09:18 am: Ponnorraks Ou: " you can't even take care of yourself"

8/05/2015 9:09:34 am: Paul Khum: Lol yep

8/05/2015 9:41:17 am: Paul Khum: Who me?

8/05/2015 9:41:18 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Apparently it was one of my conditions to sign up at my old rate to supply them a list of ppl to join.

I already told them i had no one. So everyone on my list is already signed up with fit n fast

8/05/2015 9:41:24 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Yeh

8/05/2015 9:44:03 am: Paul Khum: Man this is the first week that my upper back is sore! Fuck ye!

8/05/2015 9:44:23 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Haha

Hope it's working it and not just coz you're doing it wrong

8/05/2015 9:44:45 am: Paul Khum: I hope I'm doing it right. Lol I did really light weight. But tried to engaged the back

8/05/2015 9:45:42 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Marra u found a place yet for the ring?

Can refer u to the guy that did mine

8/05/2015 10:33:17 am: Paul Khum: Do WiFi extender reduce your WiFi speed? To where it's being extended?

8/05/2015 10:33:50 am: Paul Khum: Don't think Marra will reply for awhile, he actually does works at his job. Unlike us office bums

8/05/2015 10:34:21 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Haha true !

8/05/2015 10:34:37 am: Paul Khum: We just chat all day. 😃

8/05/2015 10:34:43 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Not sure bout the extender

Wanted one but haven't looked into it

8/05/2015 10:35:17 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Yeh was stressful getting the ring.
The guy who did mine I fully trust , so happy to refer

8/05/2015 10:35:54 am: Paul Khum: What made you trust this guy?

8/05/2015 10:36:17 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Well I was referred by Borey which helped

8/05/2015 10:36:51 am: Ponnorraks Ou: But after meeting a few diff jewellers. He makes u feel at home vs the others

8/05/2015 10:37:30 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Others can be pushy, what do u want? This is a good price trust me

8/05/2015 10:38:32 am: Ponnorraks Ou: .. With one. I asked  specifically for small diamonds on the band, a certain sized

" no u should go bigger, are you going to listen to me or what ?'

8/05/2015 10:39:47 am: Paul Khum: Hmm that's fucked

8/05/2015 10:40:02 am: Ponnorraks Ou: My guy, Sam

Shows you all the different types of diamonds. Gets you to look into the magnifier . Shows the diff colours types of clarities etc.. And how they're prices differently

8/05/2015 10:40:45 am: Paul Khum: What Nash is he?

8/05/2015 10:41:44 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Then u decide what is it you want.. Go back to him and he'll try and find the diamond for u

8/05/2015 10:43:31 am: Paul Khum: Sounds good man

8/05/2015 10:44:00 am: Paul Khum: Wasn't that stressful for me, I didn't really do anything lol. I just let jen pick it.

8/05/2015 10:45:13 am: Paul Khum: But yeah it's stressful spending that much money and worried about getting ripped off

8/05/2015 10:45:32 am: Paul Khum: Jewellers are notorious for over inflating the prices.

8/05/2015 10:46:12 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Um nots sure on his Nash

8/05/2015 10:46:24 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Yeh..

Well that's when u just do ur own research

8/05/2015 10:46:31 am: Paul Khum: Wog? Asian or Aussie?

8/05/2015 10:46:34 am: Ponnorraks Ou: I compared prices to blue  Nile

8/05/2015 10:46:40 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Wog

8/05/2015 10:46:58 am: Ponnorraks Ou: And they were reasonably comparative compared to
The site

8/05/2015 10:47:16 am: Ponnorraks Ou: So yeh I wouldn't hesitate to recommend him to any of u

8/05/2015 10:47:44 am: Paul Khum: Sounds like a good guy

8/05/2015 10:47:44 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Band was custom. Tell
Him the deisign . And he'll make it

8/05/2015 10:48:19 am: Paul Khum: Dam romeo ou

8/05/2015 10:48:57 am: Paul Khum: Hand made or from a cast?

8/05/2015 10:49:06 am: Ponnorraks Ou: I was going back and forth between him and Gregory's

Gregory's was an easy 4k more for the same thing

8/05/2015 10:49:15 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Hand made

8/05/2015 10:49:21 am: Paul Khum: Dam gregory is expensive

8/05/2015 10:53:24 am: Paul Khum: You get the wedding band from the same guy?

8/05/2015 10:53:34 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Yeh

8/05/2015 10:53:41 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Was actually looking elsewhere

8/05/2015 10:53:51 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Gregory's also

8/05/2015 10:54:05 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Then when we went to him it was like half the price

8/05/2015 10:54:12 am: Khemarint Son: Hey what's wedding band

8/05/2015 10:54:25 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Just a simple band

8/05/2015 10:54:39 am: Ponnorraks Ou: Maybe small
Diamonds on the actual band

8/05/2015 10:55:08 am: Paul Khum: You have two rings pon? A engagement and wedding band? Or is that just for the girl?

9/05/2015 12:02:42 pm: Paul Khum: Pretty much right, they'll charge what ever they want.
When the AUD$ was high, it made no difference on the price of oil. Dispite the fact that you can only buy oil with USD$.

9/05/2015 12:09:20 pm: Ponnorraks Ou: Man I'm doing oportos.

Didn't even have breakfast .

9/05/2015 1:47:50 pm: Marra Lim: I hate that.. Remember the companies that charge people based on capacity to pay.. Eventually there will be an alternative and consumers don't forget how they were once mistreated..

9/05/2015 1:50:37 pm: Marra Lim: BP Greystanes use to compete with coles/ shell down the road. We sold ice for $3 a bag,once we sold out, they would jack it up to $5-6 bucks.. That pissed people off and many customers refused to go back afterwards.

9/05/2015 1:51:11 pm: Marra Lim: You can rip people off, as long as they don't feel they are being ripped off

9/05/2015 2:00:22 pm: Terry So: Yeah, I honestly feel Marra would be good in business

9/05/2015 2:44:09 pm: Khemarint Son: Ya marra is business at heart
